[Steve Bachelor](bachelor_steve.md)
- (the specifics of) human engagement with biosphere is mutually reliant on the sorts of social arrangements and systems of social organization that people have in place
- no single "Agricultural Revolution"
	- (archaeological record has suggested otherwise)
	- adoption, abandonment, re-adoption of agriculture, and that it wasn't a [diffusionist](diffusionism.md) model
- ecology of freedom, then, is: freedom to "come into" agriculture and then leave it
	- the third element of freedom: the ability to abandon or walk away
- examples
	- nile valley
	- amazonia
- farming usually started as economy of deprivation
	- yes, evidence in fluvial plains
	- but, more often than not, farming is the result of adopting that practice only after other practices weren't available (only when other better options weren't available)
	- starting in areas where resources were the thinnest rather than the richest
- there was no linear process of agricultural revolution, but it began as fits and starts over long period of time

- nice overview of how agriculture happened across planet and not just in one place (fertile crescent)
- and that there were lots of "agricultural revolutions" and no one, simple process

**next chapter:**

will show that there were cities that relied on agriculture, but it wasn't the defining characteristic of those cities, and you could have agriculture in the absence of stratification, and you could have cities in absence of stratifications equated with urbanization

[[Nika Dubrovsky]]
- interesting to read chapter about women, agriculture, and gardening
	- direct reference to [[Silvia Federici]]
	- and the woman knowledge production
	- how women were producing the knowledge of dealing with crops and plants and wild plants and using them in different ways: medicine, etc
	- not sure if this would be called "domestication": going out into nature, figuring out how things work and how bodies can benefit or adjust to what's out there

Bachelor

- they make the link direct, the association between "domestication" and "domestic care"
- and show that "domestication" itself isn't a singular process, and that it happens in many different ways depending on the social arrangements in place
- a way to start from imagination: we're allowed to imagine the range of social and cultural possibilities, as they don't infantilize the subjects they're writing about, even though they are never, say, given names
- reminders: you can walk away and experiment, even if it's only for 20 minutes

Dubrovsky

- reference to [Murray Bookchin](bookchin_murray.md)]]'s [[Ecology of freedom]] is to agriculture now being monocrops and inducstrial production, and then contrasted to what women did: A particular connection to each individual plant, and individual plants used for specific purposes: food, abortifacients
- it's not even gardening, when you go into nature and … knowledge to use the environment
- how you define domestication as you produce certain crops over many years that his very efficient
- vs. going into the forest and getting something good for you, once, or you want to have certain strength

Simona

- no, domestication is when a plant or animal cannot survive anymore without humans

[[Niekie Rimac]]

- is the word you're looking for more like "exploitation", although that has a negative resonance

Mark Fuller

- it's a negative

Simona

- Not necessarily

[[judd_ellen]]
- the question about domestication is very important; a definition that Simona provided is one
- but there's a long path between foraging and reaching the point where flora and fauna become dependent on humans to replicate
- what's overlooked (in at least popular conceptions) is the area between those two points
	- there's specialist knowledge in that area, but not enough attention has been given to that history and contemporary practice that uses and engages with gardening in various descriptions that isn't "agriculture", and there's a huge realm of that that they are bringing attention to
	- usually if we're speaking historically we call it horticulture, if it's not as controlling as agriculture, and that's been alive and well into the modern world
	- interesting that stories of human history ignore the fact that agriculture and rigid domestication and cultivation isn't the only thing that's going on
	- what's being opened up is a range of interaction with natural world that didn't get into unilinear stories
	- it also then would also make sense that there were many places that horticulture "started"
- if you look at ethno-historical and ethnographic discussions of horticultural societies there's a strong connection with women's knowledge of plants, and with very different modes of social organization that are less patriarchal

[shukaitis_stevphen](shukaitis_stevphen.md)
- on "play farming": find it a bit strange that it sounds clunky, but i took it as: activities that go beyond foraging, in the sense that you're actively shaping and changing how plants grow and change in the environment, but in a way that isn't domestication
	- the "in between" foraging and domesetic agriculture
	- maybe that's why it's so hard to pin down, because it's an an-between liminal activity that doesn't fit into two categories[^1]

[[Michael Reinsborough]]

- on [[social ecology]], where the premise is that people's relationship to the environment deals with their social relations, but they didn't agree with the actual details, so would be interesting to see if people in social ecology movement will engage with that and try to rewrite some of the early history
- this chapter blends in well with [dawn_of_everything_ch_06_gardens_of_adonis_notes](dawn_of_everything_ch_06_gardens_of_adonis_notes.md) which looks at the sort of gender relations of the …
- but this short chapter on Ecology of Freedom is engaging just to bust the idea of the Agricultural Revolution, so looking at it as a bit -- for archaeologists, this may be a nerdy argument about details, but we wouldn't have to know that much about the archaeology to say that, if you can give clear examples, of why the Agricultural Revolution as conceived in general doesn't work, then you've successfully broken a myth down, and that's what this whole book does -- it unpicks a myth about modernization
- [[../v_gordon_child]], who invented "Agricultural Revolution" term in 30s and 40s, which is a period of time that you see technological powers (modernist, futurist, european declarations, when militarism) -- if you see this, as book undoing Rousseau, someone could take this chapter, and use it, and compare the archaeological evidence, to this early history in the 1930s and 40s of modernism and where this myth is invented, and that would make a nice edition to this genre[^2]

[[Steve Bachelor]]
- those conceptual constructions of revolution (agricultural, industrial, information), those get preserved and documented because they're forms of commerce, so what they're really documenting are the sorts of exploitative transactions that happen among state leaders, or "entrepreneurs" and state authorities
- authors make the point, if one falls into trap of using monuments (?) and agricultural records as proxies for civilization then you're really just writing a history of the state and commerce, but state-coerced commerce, and that poses a problem for the approach they're taking
	- because if they are looking at foragers or populations that relied on horticulture, then it's not going to leave that documentary basis
	- so that kind of emphasis on the commercial aspects, wasn't just a function of the evidence, but also what people though of as legitimate kinds of evidence that i think science can offer tools and technologies to allow for reconstruction of other kinds of evidence

Simona[^3]

- very point of this chapter, and chapter 6, is difference between serious and play agriculture, and the point is that serious agriculture is not a destiny of humanity, it's not the only possibility at hand, and that there is a bias in our knowledge about the other possibilities
- america before european invasion explored the other possibilities, which is why the focus is so much on indigenous americans, and when they talk about eurasia it's to confront eurasia solutions against americas solutions
- difference between serious and playful
	- in playful, you have a plurality of solutions to human needs; "play" is a strong word because they want to stress "not serious"; what's important is the opposition to "serious commitment"
- the first people that seriously committed to agriculture did so in an environment left over by forage hunters; it was a marginal solution to a food problem, and actually the wisest idea would be not to commit too seriously to agriculture; the wiser idea is to have a multiplicity of solutions
- this appears to be what happened in the Americas, and appears to have been conscious refusal on north american indigenous population, seems to be result of something that happened in [[Cahokia]]
- also the fact that in most cases, in the americas, people choose not to commit too seriously to agriculture

[[Michael Scheiner]]
- understood play farming not only as experimentation and refusal to commit to one thing, but had to happen in a time when it wasn't a matter of life and death; room and space and other resources to allow for playful experimentation; so it's not just "not taking it seriously" but "not having to take it seriously"
- comment about "serious committed agriculture" as "play-farming with benefits" [^4]
- the options, and no need to commit to toil for many hours a week, is a condition for the experimentation and forms of social experimentation which would follow
- was also reading [[Play from Baffler, Graeber]]

[shukaitis_stevphen](shukaitis_stevphen.md)
- one thing surprised by not showing up, was in [[The art of not being governed - James Scott]], which i think appears about 200 pages after this, there is a discussion about walking away from agriculture and forms of agriculture, especially those that were easier to track, regulate, and inspect
	- so for instance a preference for root vegetables as opposed to rice -- you can't hide rice, but root vegetables can be grown, and left to grow, and returned to,
	- so connection between different types of root vegetables and how that might overlap … ?

[Steve Bachelor](bachelor_steve.md)
- He (scott) does, and jim scott has a big take on the specificity of crop cultivation based on being able to hide or obscure what's being grown
- in highland areas, where there is a lot of terraced farming, that requires a level of labor input that i don't know if play farming would accommodate itself to
- Scott makes a larger argument where topography also matters; as you go higher, one is escaping state authority
	- he makes similar argument in [[Against the grain]], where he shows that in many cases the first forms of agriculture were the result of slave labor, and that it was not a good option in most cases
- the Davids are building on Scott's work nicely
- Scott is one of the few to have the kind of historical and geographical range that Graeber does

[shukaitis_stevphen](shukaitis_stevphen.md)
- in 2005 they talked about doing a project together, which never happened "for obvious reasons" ? (is scott at yale or something)

[Niekie Rimac](Niekie%20Rimac)
- have an intuition about this, when people were experimenting that it also could be a sacred science or sacred duty, and that's why they don't want to expand it or make it dominant; if it's sacred they would keep it small

[Steve Bachelor](bachelor_steve.md)
- the overlap of science, religion, and magic is, since the enlightenment, something that Western society's gotten wrong, or just separated them[^5]

[Nika Dubrovsky](Nika%20Dubrovsky)
- can we explore the difference between play and culture (since it's agri-"culture")

[[Simona]]
- i'm trying to examine the evolution of the terms in Graeber's thought, and play is one of the key words, and one element is "what's the point if we can't have fun" and the other is the last chapter of Utopia of Rules, where it's opposed to games
- i'm not sure agriculture is , culture as opposed to play, culture can be mobile thing, and has all possibilities inside it
- maybe the difference is between being constrained in one solution when you start depending on sowing and you are stuck

[Nika Dubrovsky](Nika%20Dubrovsky)
I also want to connect it to colonialism, it's said that ok this particular type of civilization invented agriculture and then, they invented something else and that's how they took over the world, in which case "culture" is code for "quality" and also for "dominance" and play, is the idea that **people do it sometimes but it's not essential**[^6]

[[Mary Tracy]]
- the narrative of the evolution of production from hunter gatherers to agriculture to industrial revolution to the information revolution has been used to justify empires, as we know, and was used to justify the british empire ("we're bringing civilization to these uncivilized people") whereas the idea of play is more friendly to the American empire, which is more of a focus on freedom, and "we're just liberating these people, and they're free to do everything they want, so long as it's convenient to us" 
- there's a danger that we take what they're saying around "play" and "freedom" and turn it into something individualized; they would say that "play" applies to the collective as well, which is something that goes against the official mainstream narrative
- this idea of societies, groups, or nation states experimenting; that is not allowed in the current framework

[[Mark Fuller]]
- three disparate points
	- [[Mary Tracy]]'s point is the difference between "anarchist" and US Libertarian play; i agree that it's dangerous
	- [Niekie Rimac](Niekie%20Rimac), [Mary Tracy](Mary%20Tracy), and [[Tanya]]? were talking about the spirituality of the cultivators, and that's where you're "listening to nature" as opposed to "telling nature what to do"
		- and where [Niekie Rimac](Niekie%20Rimac) said that "you're not going to make that a dominant force", because you're "listening to nature in a different way"
	- mystery of linear pottery tradition, whatever happened 5,000 years ago was still a mystery, even with some explanations in the background
		- when Michael and Ste??ven were talking about experimentation, it seemed like it was an experimentation with cost; something else happened there and they were suggesting that it might have been: they didn't bring enough kinds of cereal or pulse to that area, and you had established foragers on the circumference, and what happened we don't know but it was a failure of some kind
		- the theme of Ecology of Freedom is: we need to be able to experiment without those sorts of costs

[Michael Scheiner](Michael%20Scheiner)
- around concept of play, in class-based societies and contemporary capitalism with its emphasis on wage labor there's a necessary ideology that convinces that work and play have to be separate spheres: you literally have to work so you can play on the weekends; and i think in the book, showing alternative ways, shows that doesn't have to be the case, it can be pleasurable, experimental
- we do think of massive divide between one and the other
- so many work so elites can have only play

[Mary Tracy](Mary%20Tracy)
- and then the elites don't even play

[Simona](Simona)
- connection between fear and refusal of play
- tale of grasshopper and ant: 
	- in a sikh tradition there is a different tale
	- in our tradition, we are dominated by fear of starvation, and you're not serious if you're not afraid to starve, and you spend your summer singing and playing
- when europeans invaded americas, the population that reproduced a lot, indigenous americans kept freedom because they kept the population at a low level, there was plenty of space, while europeans accumulate population and goods
- the two things are related, and both are about fear, about the seven years of plenty / seven years of famine
- and so maybe the main difference between European culture and American is fear at the end of the day, and the opposition is between fear and play, and Calvinism is a successful removal of play, of everything that is "useless", and "useful" means useful in order to avoid starvation

> What ultimately lies behind the appeal of bureaucracy is fear of play

[Steve Bachelor](bachelor_steve.md)

[Michael Reinsborough](Michael%20Reinsborough.md)
- i didn't get [Nika Dubrovsky](Nika%20Dubrovsky)'s thing about culture and play until I got that the etymology of culture is culturing the soil, and that's quite funny that our modern conception of culture is rooted in the last couple hundred years
- book: undoing myth of origin of society
- my own relation to agriculture, i have family farming as a background, but most of us go to the grocery store, but the agriculture in the book isn't like the agriculture of the last couple hundred years, and the agriculture of the last hundred years is completely different from the agriculture before that; when modernization takes place, and agriculture today completely supported by fossil fuels
- one of the largest political movements, Via Campesino, which would argue that if we see industrial collapse, it's the same type of people who couple make terraces in the mountains, but that's what would keep a bunch of people alive
- the only alternative is to make sexuality play when women can get abortions ???

[Nika Dubrovsky](Nika%20Dubrovsky)
- i wanted to omcment that there are other ways to get food other than hunter-gatherers and foragers;
- we were growing spirulina with david so you do that in a jar, it's playful, it's just a question of social arrangements and individuals allowed to think differently
- in the soviet union, when it collapsed, and suddenly all the industrial cities were deprived of food, then people went to small tiny piece of land and started gardening, and 70% of grocery was produced on this tiny piece of land
	- russia isn't ukraine or italy, so it's difficult to grow things, so we would have many options

[Mary Tracy](Mary%20Tracy)
- cuba had to do the same thing when the soviet union collapsed, they had nothing so they went into the gardens and grew food everything; obviously they had a nicer climate, but there are always options if we have the political freedom or will
