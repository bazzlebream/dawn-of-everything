This chapter demonstrates that many forms of organization other than top-down hierarchy are historically common in long-lived, thriving urban situations.

Humans are cognitively capable of two distinct modes of interpersonal interaction:
1. The way you relate to your friends and family, and places, that you know directly.
2. The way you think of &quot;imaginary&quot; social units such as empires or cities, which exist largely &quot;in our heads&quot;. 

The modality of #2 is one of the reasons that there is no need to &quot;explain&quot; large groups of people interacting with one another.

Foragers live in small-scale groups, but they simultaneously live in large-scale societies. That this is true is attested by cognitive science, through which we know that humans can live within large &quot;imaginary structures&quot; as well as living at more intimate scales. It is also attested by the archaeological and anthropological findings which show that forager kin groups live with very few biological kin, and that individuals regularly expect to find welcome across vast territories from people they&#39;ve never met and in some cases don&#39;t even share a language with.
</code></pre></div><p>^905526</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Early cities (populations of 10,000 or more appearing 6kya), appearing in isolation, are so diverse, and so few had authoritarian rule, that it&#39;s hard to say they aren&#39;t self-conscious experiments with urban form. 
</code></pre></div><p>^573c2e</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>When we think about why cities first arose, we can break this question into parts:

Why did so many people end up in the same place?
1. Environmental disasters push people together, such as at Teotihuacan.
2. Stable deltaic environments, due to environmental changes occuring at the turn of the Holocene, attract large populations, such as RioSupe or the Maya lowlands.
3. The formation of &quot;black soil&quot; or &quot;chernozem&quot;, such as in Ukraine, also attracted groups.

Once cities formed, how did they stay together?
1. They were physical realizations of a pre-existing (and, in part, imaginary) extended community, such as with the Ukraine sites and the Cucuteni-Tripolyte culture.
2. What we might call eco-consciousness: a conscious attempt to nurture the rich ecologies they settled in.
3. Civic festivals created moments when imaginary structures temporarily became tangible and material.
4. A united devotion to consciously chosen values.
5. Egalitarian structures of government.

How were complex decisions made?
- Complex decisions can also be thought of as a certain uniformity in the end result and, in fact, it&#39;s the uniformity rather than deviations which requires explanation. Decisions were made by individuals who shared conceptual frameworks, such as concentric circles (reinforced by the mathematics required), or the shared values and devotions reproduced through everyday actions and festivals. These shared frameworks imparted unity to individual and small group actions.

</code></pre></div><p>^fed38c</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>&quot;Perceived simplicity&quot; does not mean actual simplicity; in many cases this mislabeling obscures different types of complexity; for instance, logistical, interpersonal, mutual aid, food production and distribution, long-distance trade, mineral extraction, ceramic creation, avoiding ecological collapse despite population size, time-sensitive activities, and corvee-type public projects.

&quot;Perceived simplicity&quot; can manifest as uniformity in housing, neighborhood, and district blueprints, and also as affirming certain roles (eg prominent role of women). However, the housing uniformity was really complex: &quot;conceptual frameworks&quot; were shared and expressed even in local decision-making, and did not require top-down imposition of housing plans, for instance. These conceptual frameworks could be as broad as &quot;entire cosmologies&quot;, such as for inhabitants of Sainte-Engr\xE2ce (Basque), who model many of their complex activities on the mathematical constraints of rotating circles.

As we will see in the next section, this &quot;perceived simplicity&quot; can &quot;scale up&quot; to larger numbers of people and denser areas, continuing to further obscure or hide complexity when people are already ignoring it.
</code></pre></div><p>^3e290b</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Just as perceived simplicity is not actual simplicity, egalitarianism is not simple. Examples include the complex logistics of diverse food and materials products, maintaining surpluses without warfare, the complex housing arrangements we saw above, scheduling duties and events when everyone has cross-cutting obligations, and intricate networks of mutual aid.
</code></pre></div><p>^938335</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>When they dug up Mesopotamia in late 1800s to early 1900s, it looked like it was a civilization of &quot;cities, monarchy, and aristocracy&quot;, and that this was the truth behind biblical descriptions of societies in this area. Even Sumerian culture, discovered during this period, seemed to confirm that impression. However, modern archaeology has found that Mesopotamia was not &quot;an eternal land of kings&quot;. Strong evidence in favor of this observation includes the absence of all signs of monarchy, which become commonplace in the historical record only after 2800 bc. These include palaces, aristocratic burials, royal inscriptions, defensive walls, and organized mililtias.
</code></pre></div><p>^23a89e</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Scholars use the term &quot;primitive democracy&quot; to refer to a state of affairs actually characterized by labor mobilization, rules answerable to town councils, occasional uprisings, and women being included in politics. First, these institutions were not crude. Second, they were not invented through &quot;royal statecraft&quot;, as is also claimed.
</code></pre></div><p>^41db1d</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Focusing on the town councils, or &quot;district councils and assemblies of elders&quot;, we see that they continue to exist up until the &#39;Early Dynastic&#39; period in Mesopotamia and in a broad geographic range; in other words, they are a persistent, reliable, and widespread element, rather than a &#39;primitive&#39; element. (I think &#39;primitive&#39; is shorthand for both &#39;immature&#39; and &#39;simple&#39;.)

Urbanites didn&#39;t need rulers; in fact, they were autonomous self-governing units which could drive out rulers or abandon the city.

At this point in the chapter we still don&#39;t know what government looked like before kingship showed up; we&#39;re going to look at Uruk for the answer to that.
</code></pre></div><p>^3921c2</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>We know when royal rule started in Uruk, and what that looks like archaeologically. We also have a good idea of what Uruk looked like before that period of time, before 3200 bc, and that helps answer the previous question regarding what government was like before the appearance of kingship, in Mesopotamian cities.

A provisional description (of the nature of government before rulers) is that, at least in Uruk, a separate, raised temple sector, whose labor source included the needy, produced standardized goods (consistently packaged and labeled) within factory-like facilities. This standardization was in contrast to the idiosyncratic productions of individuals, who built and maintained the irrigation systems, roads, and embankments. The ultimate goal was to provide for the gods and goddesses of the city.

The top-down bureaucratic procedures were &quot;limited&quot; to the &quot;commodity sphere&quot;, while the bottom-up town councils were responsible for public works and &quot;international relations&quot;. (In modernish words, the state did capitalist stuff, and the private sector did government stuff.)

Importantly, this description pertains to &quot;before&quot; (historically, not logically) there was a ruler or monarch.
</code></pre></div><p>^0268d6</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Having kind of answered the question &quot;what was the nature of government in Mesopotamia before rulers&quot;, let&#39;s look at something else. Uruk expanded and tried to impose its administrative commercial standardization ethos on others along its trade routes. In conscious rejection of this (aka schismogenesis) there developed what is called the &quot;heroic society&quot;: think Beowulf, the Celtic kings, the Maori, or the 19th century Pacific Northwest Coast.

(Looking ahead to the three forms of power, this type of society employs the &quot;politics&quot; or &quot;charisma&quot; form of power, while Uruk exemplifies the &quot;information&quot; or &quot;bureaucracy&quot; form of power.)

</code></pre></div><p>^fc5536</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Historically (and maybe logically) before the straight-up caste system (varna), there was a hierarchical division of social functions (purity over merchandry), an ascending scale of purity, but no &quot;charismatic authority figures&quot; (that is, no warrior aristocracy or heroic accumulation).

It&#39;s possible (and even likely) that egalitarian practical mechanisms of local government can exist within a hierarchy of social orders. We have the Bali&#39;s current seka system as an example. Furthermore, the seka&#39;s egalitarian mechanisms are responsible for agriculture that&#39;s feeding a dense population (showing that agriculture doesn&#39;t have to be associated with governance hierarchy.)
</code></pre></div><p>^75f0cb</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>We can articulate the logic or modalities of egalitarian ethos. There are two main modalities, and a possible third. They are:
1. Everyone is precisely the same, in ways we consider important (Uruk).
2. Everyone is so utterly different that there&#39;s no criteria for comparison (Ukranian megasites).
3. Rigorous equality in certain areas, with explicit hierarchy elsewhere (Indus valley).
</code></pre></div><p>^dbeef6</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Scale (area, population, density) and city-style life don&#39;t lead to states automatically; cities can lead to (and be made possible by) egalitarianism.
</code></pre></div><p>^74aa96</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>Unfortunately, what we&#39;ve been showing seems to imply that even if things start not-authoritarian, they end up going authoritarian, even if civic institutions and independent cities never go away entirely.

Fortunately, China shows the reverse happening, which means there&#39;s at least a way &quot;back&quot; to not-authoritarian (even if not-authoritarian to authoritarian is possible too).

And Mesoamerica and Teotihuacan will illustrate this as well, in chapter 9.
