The Standard Narrative posits that top-down hierarchies and violent domination were the inevitable result of people beginning to farm To the contrary, in this chapter we establish that some of the places where farming was adopted had little if any violent domination. So why is our situation characterized by the top-down hierarchies and violent domination, and why do we seem to be stuck in that situation?</p><h2 id="_2-what-idea-s-embody-the-spirit-of-the-first-agriculturalists" tabindex="-1">2.
