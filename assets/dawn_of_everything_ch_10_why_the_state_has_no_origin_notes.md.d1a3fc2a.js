However, academics often act as though such patterns did exist, and divide up time and space label the resulting those divisions. These names become canonical. (Examples include things like &quot;post&quot; and &quot;proto&quot;, and Egyptian terms like &quot;Old&quot;, &quot;Middle&quot;, and &quot;New&quot; Kingdoms.) More specifically, and started by German models, the &quot;pattern&quot; consists of supposed alternations between &quot;unity&quot; and &quot;disintegration&quot;, and only the &quot;unity&quot; periods are thought to constitute the real, interesting history.</p><p>(extending to next \xA7s)</p><p>An alternate approach involves concentrating on these interstitial (apparently boring and unstable) periods. Doing so reveals examples of &quot;First Order regimes&quot;. In a First Order regime, the society stresses to an exceptional degree, and develops on a large scale, one particular form of the elementary principles of domination. charismatic politics (Olmec) and knowledge-control (Chav\xEDn) and sovereignty (Natchez and also the [[Shilluk]])</p><p>A few things become evident from these examples:</p><ul><li>None of these would be labeled &quot;states&quot;.</li><li>None of them are &quot;egalitarian&quot;.</li><li>All are organized around an elite class.</li><li>It is unclear how much the existence of the elite class actually restricted freedoms.</li><li>None of them could &quot;mobilize labor&quot; reliably, if at all.</li></ul><p>In order to understand how any of these First Order regimes might becomes states, the cases of Egypt and Anyang are instructive. In Anyang, victims at royal burials are war captives. In Egypt, they are either royal family or close retainers and carers. Since Egypt and Anyang are cases of &quot;sovereignty&quot; as the organizing principle, it looks like sovereignty gains power by &quot;turning violence into kinship&quot; (killing people makes them part of the royal house) and &quot;turning the process of producing kinship&quot; into the process of producing kingship (they are turned into members of the royal house, and this violence itself produces the king-y-ness of the rulers).</p><p>By examining Egypt, a method for state formation becomes clear. A focus on &quot;sovereignty&quot;, maybe confined to rituals, leads to murder on the death of a ruler. Having to provide for the dead ruler (through mortuary cults, etc) allows for the reorganization of all social life around that goal. More specifics regarding this process become clear, including:</p><ul><li>creation of classes by indebting certain families to others to fulfill their mortuary obligations (the various offerings now being a ritual necessity)</li><li>creation of the world&#39;s first peasantry</li><li>creation of &quot;social machines&quot; (that is, roughly, production lines where people are the machines) based on the organization of maritime activities</li><li>celebrations afterwards</li><li>nascent &quot;knowledge-control&quot; elements by requiring the factory workers to undergo age-grade rituals</li></ul><p>[408]</p><h3 id="\xA7-intro-379-380" tabindex="-1">\xA7 intro [379-380) <a class="header-anchor" href="#\xA7-intro-379-380" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><ul><li>why terms like : post, proto, intermediate, terminal <ul><li>products of [[early-twentieth-century cultural theory]]</li><li>[[Alfred Kroeber]], anthropologist, wanted to look for laws behind cultural growth and decay; ie if you could establish systematic relations between different large-scale events or periods <ul><li>he concluded: no, there weren&#39;t</li><li>[[Configurations of Cultural Growth]] (1944)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><div class="language-"><pre><code>- Yet, in writing about the past, we act as though patterns did exist.
