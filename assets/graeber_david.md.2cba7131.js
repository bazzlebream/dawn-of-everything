But it doesn&#39;t relaly work. In fact, Iroquoia seems to be precisely one of those regions of North America where violence flared up only during certain specific historical periods and then largely disappeared in others. In what archaeologists term the \u2018Middle Woodland\u2019 phase, for instance, between 100 bc and ad 500 \u2013 corresponding roughly to the heyday of the Hopewell civilization \u2013 there seems to have been general peace.12 Later on, signs of endemic warfare reappear. Clearly, at some points in their history people living in this region found effective ways to ensure that vendettas didn\u2019t escalate into a spiral of retaliation or actual warfare (the Haudenosaunee story of the Great Law of the Peace seems to be about precisely such a moment); at other times, the system broke down and the possibility of sadistic cruelty returned.</p></li><li><p>reversing polarities</p></li><li><blockquote><p>What this meant, in practice, was reversing a lot of polarities.
