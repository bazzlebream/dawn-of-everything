While the field of anthropology came into existence during the \u2018decade of Darwin\u2019 (i.e. between the publication of The Origin of Species in 1859 and The Descent of Man in 1871), it was not actually Darwinism but archaeological excavations that established the timescale of human prehistory as we know it. Geology paved the way, replacing the biblically inspired view of earth\u2019s genesis as a series of rapid titanic upheavals with a more mechanistic and gradual account of our planet\u2019s origins. More detailed studies of the early development of scientific prehistory, and how fossil evidence and stone tools were first fitted into this expanded chronology of life on earth, can be found in Schnapp 1993 and Trigger 2006.\u201D <a href="./dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.html">The dawn of everything</a> p 538 (notes) [^11]: in the sense of myth used in this chapter in DoE [^12]: DoE call this &quot;mitochondrial Eve&quot; and that DNA sequencing mitochondria demonstrated that such a organism must have existed perhaps only 120kya [^13]: &quot;human origins research&quot;: CK defines this in the next paragraph, I believe: if you are interested in how we became human \u2013 how we developed our unusually revealing eyes, our extraordinarily large brains, our distinctively social emotions, our laughter, our innate capacity for music and language \u2013 you won\u2019t find anything at all!</p>',45),r=[n];function s(l,h,u,d,c,p){return i(),t("div",null,r)}var y=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
