We are witnessing the first known emergence of what Hector Munro Chadwick famously called \u2018heroic societies\u2019 and, moreover, these societies all seem to have emerged just where his analysis tells us to expect them: on the margins of bureaucratically ordered cities.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Writing in the 1920s, Chadwick \u2013 Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Cambridge, at much the same time J. R. R. Tolkien held that post at Oxford \u2013 was initially concerned with why great traditions of epic poetry (Nordic sagas, the works of Homer, the Ramayana) always seemed to emerge among people in contact with and often employed by the urban civilizations of their day, but who ultimately rejected the values of those same civilizations. For a long time, his notion of \u2018heroic societies\u2019 fell into a certain disfavour: there was a widespread assumption that such societies did not really exist but were, like the society represented in Homer\u2019s Iliad, retroactively \u201Creconstructed in epic literature[^1]</p></blockquote><p>[\u2026]</p><blockquote><p>&#39;Politics&#39;, in such societies, was composed of a history of personal debts of loyalty or vengeance between heroic individuals; all, moreover, focus on game-like contests as the primary business of ritual, indeed political, life. <a href="./dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.html">Dawn of everything</a> p 311</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Inside their own societies, at least, they also rejected commerce. Hence standardized currency, either in physical or credit forms, tended to be eschewed, with the focus instead on unique material treasures.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Aristocracies, <strong>perhaps monarchy itself</strong>, first emerged in opposition to the egalitarian cities of the Mesopotamian plains, for which they likely had much the same mixed but ultimately hostile and murderous feelings as Alaric the Goth would later have towards Rome and everything it stood for, Genghis Khan towards Samarkand or Merv, or Timur towards Delhi.
