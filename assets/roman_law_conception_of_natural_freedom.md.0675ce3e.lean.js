In Roman Law property isn\u2019t even exactly a right, since rights are negotiated with others and involve mutual obligations; it\u2019s simply power \u2013 the blunt reality that someone in possession of a thing can do anything he wants with it, except that which is limited \u2018by force or law\u2019. This formulation has some peculiarities that jurists have struggled with ever since, as it implies freedom is essentially a state of primordial exception to the legal order. It also implies that property is not a set of understandings between people over who gets to use or look after things, but rather a relation between a person and an object characterized by absolute power.
