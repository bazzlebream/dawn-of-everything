Anthropology &quot;reproduced&quot; this idea by positioning themselves as the scientists who lived in a changing history, and their subjects as living in repeated, archetypal, enduring structures. <a href="./mircea_eliade.html">Mircea Eliade</a>&#39;s <a href="./eliade_theory_cyclical_time.html">theory</a> that so-called traditional societies live in &quot;cyclical time&quot;, while essentially Enlightenment-affected people live in linear time, was another version (with a nasty fascistic and anti-Semitic twist). Similarly, people in the social sciences don&#39;t consider a social event fully explained, or really explained, unless the account shows that humans are determined by forces outside their control.</p><p>However, it&#39;s pretty clear that all human societies are capable of self-conscious political action which is not predetermined by sudden breakthroughs or other uncontrollable changes. Most human knowledge is accumulated over long periods of time, probably mostly by women, and &quot;stored&quot; in rituals, games, and forms of play (including &quot;play farming&quot;). This knowledge is accessible and can be applied to pragmatic problems and used for social experimentation. This social experimentation, furthermore, often contributes to new types of social organization which people actually live in for parts of the year (like seasonal changes between villages and dispersed foraging groups).</p><p>If human societies have always had these figurative libraries (or &quot;zones of ritual play&quot; as A M Hocart called them) to use as inspiration for experimentation of all sorts, then why don&#39;t we actually experiment anymore with forms of social existence? The answer will rely on the connection between external war and the loss of internal freedoms, or military violence and the patriarchal household</p><p>and we have to explain that roman law &quot;freedoms&quot; are about, within a patriarchal household, pretending &quot;care&quot; (love) is abusing and murdering the subordinates who care for you (which you own, as captured warriors, through external violence), while for the Wendat, you never hurt people who are part of the household; you only hurt enemies and care for family. Aka you separate care and violence, while for Romans you confused care and violence.</p><p>while there&#39;s still play, you won&#39;t get stuck? when play becomes murder, you can ?</p><ul><li>fallacy of scale</li><li>cities really hospitality zones compressed</li><li>origin of monarchy probably the heroic societies around Mesopotamian admin cities</li><li>cities can have monarchy or not, or get rid of it or not</li><li></li></ul><p>Remember, one of our questions is: when did things go wrong, such that it became possible to get stuck? (Well, probably when the third freedom was difficult or impossible. )</p><p>Well, if you at least have the first two freedoms, the sovereignty angle can only manifest as &quot;play&quot;. That is, of course, until people start being killed. There&#39;s two main ways of killing we&#39;re interested in: rituals inside society, and warfare external to a society.

In Europe during this period, the first two freedoms (to move and disobey) were not always available.[^2] So when rulers started to go from &quot;play kings&quot; to permanent kings, typically through external violence (against other culture areas) or internal violence (when one ruler died and another stepped in), people were unable easily to find another situation with a &quot;play king&quot;</p><p>different notions of what &quot;freedom&quot; was, and what that means for social structures at all levels (household to super-kingdom)</p><ul><li>wendat: just care</li><li>europe: violence + care <ul><li>sees culmination in Roman private property laws based on slavery</li><li>hunter-gatherers with Ice Age weirdos &gt; Egypt &gt; (cities with councils &gt; dynasts (the heroic polity monarchs?) come in &gt; coexist with urban government institutions) &gt; external war &gt; their weird retinues &gt; incorporation of war captives &gt; <strong>stratification</strong> into ruler, retainers, widows + orphans + others &gt; loss of expectation of 1st freedom &gt; erodes 2nd freedom</li></ul></li></ul><p>are these different theses?</p><p>Warfare only really shows up at the end of the Ice Age with <strong>cultural areas</strong> and schismogenesis.

These individuals were probably cared for quite well during life. They would like tentatively to draw a line between this practice, through an similar practice during Predynastic Egypt, up to the practice of (all documented) royal courts taking in three kinds of the dispossessed: (i) widows and orphans; (ii) war captives; (iii) others. It&#39;s possible that top-down forms of organization snuck in, as it were, through this back door, even in societies self-consciously organized to block coercive power from developing. These rulers had the potential of the young, male war captives to work with and, as the refuge attracted more of the &quot;others&quot; group, the refuge itself became more of a poor house, and the first group, the widows and orphans, who before had been treated well and may even have had a special status, saw their status drop. So the chief&#39;s retinue consisted of a chief, his retainers, and then the completely dependent.</p><p>They close with reflections on the process of writing the book and creating a new language with which to describe things that have been very difficult to describe with the current lexicons.</p><p>[^1]: North American examples include the North West Coast societies&#39; rejection of slavery. In Central Europe this is first seen during the post-Ice Age Mesolithic. [^2]: North America remained sparsely populated and huge uninhabited territories existed.
