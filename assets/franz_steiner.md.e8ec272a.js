A brilliant polymath born to a Jewish family in Bohemia, he later lived with an Arab family in Jerusalem until expelled by the British authorities, conducted fieldwork in the Carpathians and was twice forced by the Nazis to flee the continent, ending his career \u2013 ironically enough \u2013 in the south of England. Most of his immediate family were killed at Birkenau. Legend has it that he completed 800 pages of a monumental doctoral dissertation on the comparative sociology of slavery, only to have the suitcase containing his drafts and research notes stolen on a train. He was friends with, and a romantic rival to, Elias Canetti, another Jewish exile at Oxford and a successful suitor to the novelist Iris Murdoch \u2013 although two days after she\u2019d accepted his proposal of marriage, Steiner died of a heart attack. He was forty-three.[^1]</p></blockquote><h2 id="extant-doctoral-work" tabindex="-1">extant doctoral work <a class="header-anchor" href="#extant-doctoral-work" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p><a href="./pre-servile_institutions.html">pre-servile institutions</a></p><h2 id="training" tabindex="-1">training <a class="header-anchor" href="#training" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>in the [[central European tradition]]</p><p>[^1]: <a href="./dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.html">Dawn of everything</a> p 519</p>',8),o=[n];function s(d,l,h,c,f,p){return t(),a("div",null,o)}var g=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
