# When marriage became permanent

##  When marriage became permanent

He's trying to answer question of previous section:

> This final question is a truly profound one. It can only be answered, however, once we have developed some realistic notion of the situation that previously prevailed. Was there ever a time when our prehistoric ancestors were truly free, truly ‘unstuck’?

And says:

> G&W are right to view some kind of block on political oscillation as something which really did happen during the course of history.

ie. because these patterns of oscillation having been going on for so long, it's highly likely that they were "block[ed]" at some point

> Under such arrangements, everyone alternates between kinship and marital life

This is a potentially interesting point, insofar as I think he's saying: Look, we don't even have to go as far as seasonal or lunar oscillations; it's enough that individuals experience the differences in felt social structure between kinship and their own marriage(s) to explain self-conscious political actors.

>  Across much of the world, the patriarchal forces that transformed marriage into a fixed bond correspondingly imposed fixity on social life as a whole.

## How humanity got ‘stuck’
Knight's answer to how we got stuck is the above quote.

He thinks DoE's answer is a meandering version of his, in places:

> They mention how care for a person may morph seamlessly into coercive control – but for some reason don’t connect this with changes in postmarital residence or family life.

That is, Knight would like them to find the answer in the development of the patriarchy and marriage. 

He does try to make sense of them on their own terms:

> If the bewildering words quoted above mean anything, they seem to suggest that we got stuck because certain power-hungry figures confused caring for people with violently dominating them.

> Did people really get confused in this way?

First, I think he takes "confused" in the individual psychological sense, rather than an abstract sense, as in "the seemingly separate logical categories of care and domination became intermixed" rather than "King Bob forgot what 'care' meant and beat his servant to death, thinking that was caring."

Knight goes on:

> Does this newly established nexus between external violence and internal care – between the most impersonal and the most intimate of human relations – mark the point where everything begins to get confused? Is this an example of how relations that were once flexible and negotiable ended up getting fixed in place: an example, in other words, of how we effectively got stuck?[^1]

I actually do, now, not quite know what this section is saying.

## Morgan and Engels

i don't really know what to do with this:

> What is missing here is any real understanding of human evolution. In Chapter 3, G&W criticize what they describe as the mainstream anthropological consensus for likening our foraging ancestors to extant African hunter-gatherers – simple folk living in ‘tiny mobile bands’. Then in Chapter 4 they change their mind. The mainstream anthropological consensus, they now tell us, is that hunter-gatherers such as Aboriginal Australians:

> … could travel halfway across the continent, moving among people who spoke entirely different languages, and still find camps divided into the same kinds of totemic moieties that existed at home. What this means is that half the residents owed them hospitality, but had to be treated as ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ (so sexual relations were strictly prohibited); while another half were both potential enemies and marriage partners.



> In the beginning, they say, was private property, religion and the state.

They definitively *do not* say that "the state" was in the beginning. In fact, Graeber, from his readings, didn't even really agree with the current use of the term, or the academic focus on it, and in fact broke its contemporary manifestation into its logical and historical parts.

> In an earlier book with Marshall Sahlins, _On Kings_ (2017), Graeber even suggested that since imagined supernatural agents such as divine kings and forest spirits have always exercised authority over people, the principle of the state is an immovable feature of the human condition.[^2]

My understanding of Graeber's point here, at least one relevant to what Knight is saying, is that an imagined cosmological polity was[^3] and is[^4] a necessary precondition for the emergence of *actual* kings. I believe, again with Wengrow, in [[Farewell to the childhood of man]], they wrote some of the arguments which made it in slightly altered form into [The dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md). Knight believes they are saying the "the principle of the state is an immovable feature of the human condition" but:
1. At least in *On Kings*, Graeber estalishes that the "state" isn't a thing, it's just a happenstance actuality of a bunch of different logically possible social arrangements occurring at the same historical moment; therefore, there is no "principle of the state" for him.
2. The imagined cosmological polity is as much about scary demons and shit who will straight up murder you if you order your newphew to do something, as it is about gods that are templates for kings; it's a source of power (which I think is both alienated human power, but also real, unpredictable power, like the tides and biological life) which can be invoked to reinforce the actual processes of a given social structure, be they hierarchical or egalitarian.

>  Yes, say the authors, anarchist freedom can be implemented, but only in precious moments or enclaves.

I'm not sure where they say this but, if they do, their point is that:
1. The extent of the current bad situation is so great that anarchist experiements don't currently have much room to operate in.
2. Actually, there are quite large anarchist experiments going on, like Rojava and the Zapatistas, it's just that we don't hear anything about them because it's literally the last thing the current system would ever want us to learn about.

>  Instead, they offer only the sobering message that ‘hierarchy and equality tend to emerge together, as complements to one another’. (p. 208) They seem to be saying that we cannot have freedom in one place without accepting oppression somewhere else.

Ironically, it's here, where DoE is making an empirical point, that Knight takes them to be making a logical point. He truncates the preceding clause, which when included makes the quote: "Finally, all this suggests that, historically speaking, hierarchy and equality tend to emerge together, as complements to one another." DoE is saying that *in the historical record*, these two types of organization of social relations are, *for the most part but not always*, co-constitutive or at least relatively simultaneous to a particular area. 

Unfortunately, the position that "we cannot have freedom in one place without accepting oppression somewhere else" is, in a similar form, stated in the book. However, the "oppression", to bring *On Kings* into it again, can be largely imaginary, in the sense that there are both imagined consequences for non-freedom behaviors, and that oppressive forces always wait in the wings, as it were, in case one's guard is let down.

## Where do we go from here?

> Despite these criticisms, the one important point about this book is its advocacy of oscillation.

I'm not sure that it "advocates" for oscillation.

> We need to get Planet Earth turning once more, not just physically but socially and politically, too. This will not be done by telling people to stop confusing care with dominance and control. It will be done by supporting the school strikes, singing on their picket lines, extending the action to workplaces, dancing in the streets, blocking traffic, bringing capitalism to a complete halt.

Knight seems to be saying that writing books which bring greater understanding of fundamental conditions of human existence, or at least theorize about them, are less helpful than practical actions. This is certainly a solid anarchism perspective, but, first, Graeber, up until his death, participated in stuff like this all the time, and, second, I think implying that anthropologists should not publish books intended for the general public even while activisming is absolutely wild.

The last two paragraphs I think I don't know how to deal with.
