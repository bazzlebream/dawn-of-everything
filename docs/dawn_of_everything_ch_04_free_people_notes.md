# Dawn of Everything: Ch 4: Free People, the Origin of Cultures, and the Advent of Private Property (notes) (120-163)

--- 

## 1. terms

- **abundance**:[^1][^26]
	- "abundance" is not an absolute measure; (it's relative to the society? or the person?)
	- "a situation where one has easy access to everything one feels one needs to live a happy and comfortable life"
	- if your needs are easy to satisfy, for example, then you can live in abundance with little "work"
- **autonomy**: the ability to make decisions without interference (whether are individuals or collectively)[^2]
- **foragers**: Foragers are populations which don’t rely on biologically domesticated plants and animals as their primary sources of food.[^3]
- **hierarchy**: the belief that certain people or types of people are superior to others[^4]
- **mesolithic** (12,000 bc and the next few thousand years)
	- a postglacial period when the glaciers were receeding and temperatures were rising
- **culture areas**:[^5]  
	- [mesolithic](<[mesolithic](mesolithic.md)>)
		- very large
	- [neolithic](neolithic.md)
		- small compared to those during mesolithic, but still bigger than most nations nowadays
		- associated with first farming populations
	- (much later "micro-differentiation") ethnographic or anthropologically familiar:
		- single river valley containing a half-dozen different systems
			- eg. in Amazonia or Papua New Guinea
- **micro-differentiation**
	- the proliferation of separate social and cultural universes – confined in space and relatively bounded
	- a noticeable historic trend
	- amenable to "extraordinary cultural inventiveness"
	- reproduced by people settings themselves off against each other (schismogenesis)

**text subchapter division**: *(1) in which we describe how the overall course of human history has meant that most people live their lives on an ever-smaller scale as populations get larger*^[pp 121-125]
- #stuck What are the preconditions in order for some people to "claim permanent power over others"^[p 121]
	- existence of discrete societies
	- self-contained society abandons seasonal dispersal and settles into hierarchical arrangement permanently
	- "agriculture" is neither necessary nor sufficient
		- agriculture not necessary: even without agriculture, there was [forager monumentality](forager_monumentality.md)
		- agriculture not sufficient: even when agriculture, no permanent domination: [  ??  ]
	- [[NOT surplus]]

- [[defining egalitarianism]]
	- and differences never translate into systematic inequalities of power

[comments on scale or social worlds](comments_on_scale_or_social_worlds.md)

## 2. emergence of discrete societies from non-discrete societies

### 2.1. non-discrete societies

- 40,000 years ago, society per se "spanned continents"^[p 123]

#### 2.1.1. examples of not-discrete societies

- archaeologic
	- mammoth hunters from Swiss Alps to Outer Mongoli during  [European Upper Paleolithic](european_upper_paleolithic.md)
- ethnographic
	- [East African Hadza](east_african_hadza.md)
	- [Australian Martu](australian_martu.md)

#### 2.1.2. characteristics of not-discrete societies

- "forager societies"
- numerically small nowadays (larger during archaeologic periods)
- "cosmopolitan" makeup
- structure
	- forager bands
	- large residental groups (larger than the forager bands)
		- mostly not biologically related (biological relations ~ 10%)
		- most drawn from far away
		- some don't speak the same first languages

#### 2.1.3. regional organization of not-discrete societies

- extended thousands of miles (smaller nowadays for obvious reasons)
	- eg. 40,000 years ago
	- eg. before European settlers
- same moeities[^moeities] or clans found at those distant locations as at home, even if first languages were different
	- eg. Aboriginal Australians moved across the continent, found members of same moieties
	- eg. North American ~1500 ad, from Great Lakes to Louisiana, found members of same clans
- importantly, finding the same social structures meant they could expect hospitality from their same moeity

### 2.2. beginnings of discrete societies ("culture areas")^[p 124]

- archaeologically, separate cultures can be traced starting in the mesolithic:
	- foragers that follow mammoth herds
	- fisherfolk who reside on the coasts and gather nuts from forests
	- different technologies in Africa and East Asia related to food preparation, storing, and preserving
		- #tangent spreads and paves way for "cuisine"^[p 123]
			- #implied cuisine is related to civilization
- markers of difference
	- cuisines (which are clearer in the archeological record)
	- clothing
	- dancing
	- drugs
	- hairstyles
	- courtship rituals
	- kinship organization
	- rhetoric

### 2.3. what are the mechanisms that cause human beings to spend so much effort trying to demonstrate that they are different from their neighbours (will consider in next chapter)

#stuck
- micro-differentiation (schismogenesis?) "must have contributed to the emergence of more durable and intransigent forms of domination"
	- people **not** on the move; where one might move to:
		- freedom #1, escape
	- people **not** seasonally changing social forms (freedom #3)
		- hard to exercise power over someone you will be equals with next season, or completely switched with next year
		- #what (what is cultural porosity?)
			> Cultural porosity is also necessary for the kind of seasonal demographic pulses that made it possible for societies to alternate periodically between different political arrangements, forming massive congregations at one time of year, then dispersing into a multitude of smaller units for the remainder.^[p 125]

**text subchapter division** *(2) in which we ask what, precisely, is equalized in ‘egalitarian’ societies?* ^[pp 125-135]
[in which we ask what, precisely, is equalized in ‘egalitarian’ societies?
](in_which_we_ask_what_precisely_is_equalized_in_egalitarian_societies.md)

[my notes when I was reading what Chris Knight wrote](in_which_we_ask_what_precisely_is_equalized_in_egalitarian_societies.md) / [Wrong About (Almost) Everything](wrong_about_almost_everything_chris_knight.md) treats of this section

**conclusion ahead of time**
(from the transition to sacred / private property later in the chapter
> Most obviously, that we can now put a final nail in the coffin of the prevailing view that human beings lived more or less like Kalahari Bushmen, until the invention of agriculture sent everything askew. Even were it possible to write off Pleistocene mammoth hunters as some kind of strange anomaly, the same clearly cannot be said for the period that immediately followed the glaciers’ retreat, when dozens of new societies began to form along resource-rich coasts, estuaries and river valleys, gathering in large and often permanent settlements, creating entirely new industries, building monuments according to mathematical principles, developing regional cuisines, and so on.
> We have also learned that at least some of these societies developed a material infrastructure capable of supporting royal courts and standing armies – even though we have, as yet, no clear evidence that they actually did so. To construct the earthworks at Poverty Point, for instance, must have taken enormous amounts of human labour and a strict regime of carefully planned-out work, but we still have little idea how that labour was organized. Japanese archaeologists, surveying thousands of years’ worth of Jōmon sites, have discovered all sorts of treasures, but they are yet to find indisputable evidence that those treasures were monopolized by any sort of aristocracy or ruling elite. ^[p 157]

### 2.4. the "self-contained society abandons seasonal dispersal and settles into hierarchical arrangement permanently" part of getting stuck

- likelihood of getting stuck increases with:
	- [[mesolithic]] [[local cultural worlds]]
		- self-contained society abandons seasonal dispersal and settles into hierarchical arrangement permanently

- that's just probability, though
- why (reasons, causes?) did it actually happen

- “origins of social inequality”
	- what does inequality mean
	- what does "[[egalitarian_society]]" mean
	- [["how egalitarian" dilemma]]
		- solutions:
			- [[universal equality standard]]
				- historically: [[means of subsistence]] standard
					- led to: treat hunter-gatherers as distinct variety of humans
					- combined with [[Roussea's theory of the origins of inequality]] (agriculture)
						- (and, conversely, without agriculture, you'd almost have to be egalitarian, since you don't have "productive assets" or "surpluses" of farming)
					- combined with conventional wisdom/ [Rousseau's theory of the origin of the state](rousseau_s_theory_of_the_origin_of_the_state.md) (material surplus leads to state)
					- (it's the "inexorability" here that DoE argues against)

- yes, agriculture^[cereal farming, grain storage, etc] is a necessary [[condition of possibility]] of bureaucratic regimes like "Pharaonic Egypt, Maurya Empire, Han China"
- **but, agriculture didn't *cause* those states**
	- 6000 years between first middle east farmers and rise of those "states"
	- in many parts of world, farming *never* led to emergence of anything like those states

---

## 3. mini-summation

#theme

why did we get stuck with domination?

- historical attempt to define egalitarian
- attempt to rank egalitarianism
- development of a universal equality standard
- use means of subsistence as a standard
- ??
- agriculture leads to inequality, according to Rousseau
- **material surplus** leads to the state, according to Rousseau
- this is inexorable

let's change this to:

- agriculture is a necessary condition of possibility for bureaucratic regimes like "Pharaonic Egypt, Maurya Empire, Han China"
- agriculture is not an inexorable cause of states like that

### 3.1. the different levels of causation

From weakest to strongest claim, or broadest to most narrow.

- 1. "x made *possible* y"
- 2. "without x, y *would not have been possible*"
	- (I believe this is sometimes phrased as x is a "necessary" condition of y)
	> only cereal-farming and grain storage made possible bureaucratic regimes like those of Pharaonic Egypt, the Maurya Empire or Han China[^20]
- 3.
	- 3a. "x set off a *chain of events* that made y *likely*"
		- eg. invention of calculus to nuclear weapons
	- 3b. "x made y *more likely*"
- 4. "x caused y"
	- ways to disprove:
		- if a lot of time passes between x and y
		- if in many cases x never resulted in y

#stuck
- difference between
	- conditions that make it "more likely" to experience conditions amenable to getting stuck
	- why any particular society got stuck

- defining "egalitarianism"?
	- negative definitions
		- absence of hierarchies
		- absence of relations of domination or exploitation
		- absence of surplus
			- see [Woodburn's definition of truly egalitarian societies](woodburn_s_definition_of_truly_egalitarian_societies.md) below

- differentiate from uniformity, equality, homogeneity
- when egalitarianism seems to refer to presence of an ideal, what "an ideal" means[^18]
	- X people themselves feel they ought to be the same "in the ways that really matter"
	- ideal is "largely" realized
- next step? reformulation?
	- premise: all societies are organized around certain key values
	- egalitarian societies: where everyone agrees that the paramount values should be, and are, distributed equally[^19]
		- problem with this:
			- different societies think different values are important
				- the 50% sharecropper society
		- way to solve problem:
			- create objective standards to measure equality
				- since Rousseau and Smith (mid-late 18th cent), focus on property arrangements
					- (same time started ranking societies by means of subsistence, which meant hunter-gatherers "distinct variety of human being")

[^spanned_continents]:  p 123
[^moeities]: **moeities**: Logical and social division into two groups characterized, at the most abstract level, just in being antipoles of one another.
[^culture_areas]: p 124
[^3]: p 124
[^4]: p 124, first mention
[^5]: p 125
[^7]: >  So, as a first approximation, we can speak of an egalitarian society if (1) most people in a given society feel they really ought to be the same in some specific way, or ways, that are agreed to be particularly important; and (2) that ideal can be said to be largely achieved in practice.

[^10]: see [Eleanor Leacock](leacock_eleanor.md)
[^12]: p 153
[^14]: taken from [The original affluent society](The_original_affluent_society.md)
[^15]: in which we discuss marshall sahlins’s ‘original affluent society’ and reflect on what can happen when even very insightful people write about prehistory in the absence of actual evidence (135-141)
[^16]: in which we show how new discoveries concerning ancient hunter-gatherers in north america and japan are turning social evolution on its head (141-148)
[^17]: how the myth that foragers live in a state of infantile simplicity is kept alive today (or, informal fallacies) (148-153)
[^18]: in which we dispose of one particularly silly argument that foragers who settle in territories that lend themselves well to foraging are somehow unusual (153-156)
[^19]: in which we finally return to the question of property, and inquire as to its relation to the sacred (156-163]
[^20]: p 127
[^22]: That is, describing [Upper Paleolithic](european_upper_paleolithic.md) mammoth hunters as divided into "societies" doesn't really make sense, or at least not as much sense as European nations, or even Canadian First Nations.
