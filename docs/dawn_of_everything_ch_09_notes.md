# Dawn of Everything: Ch 9: Hiding in plain sight (notes)

#subchapter *The indigenous origins of social housing and democracy in the Americas* (p 328-333)


(historically early, but mentioned interspersed)
- [[Olmec]]

## 1. Classic Maya (c ad 150-900) (in the lowlands)

Maya and Zapotec

lowland

'package' of Mesoamerican kingship[^24]
- cities:
	- instances
		- [[Tikal]]
		- [[Calakmul]]
		- [[Palenque]]
	- characterized by: [[standard package of Mesoamerican kingsip]] (layperson)
		- royal temples
		- ball courts (lethal games)
		- images of war and publicly killed captives
		- calendar rituals about royal ancestors
		- deeds of living kings
		- great tombs
			- [[Sihyaj CHan K'awiil]] at [Tikal](Tikal.md)
			- [[K'inich Janaab Pakal]] at [Palenque](Palenque.md)
		- art style
			- relief carving
			- curves
			- flowing forms

## 2. Teotihuacan (in the highlands)

"republican" tradition

highland

- all of this absent
	- few written inscriptions
	- lots of pictorial art
		- no representations of ruler doing anything nasty to a subordinate (unlike maya and zapotec)
		- deliberate inversion of Mesoamerican compositional principles
			- flat composites
			- angular blocks
			- tight fits
		- celebrates community as a whole and its collective values
		- conscious cultural inversion (aka [[schismogenesis]] , according to [Esther Pasztory](Esther_Pasztory.md)
			- new tradition of art created to express difference
			- rejects
				- visual trope of ruler and captive
				- glorification of aristocrats
			- [Teotihuacan](Teotihuacan.md) was utopian experiment in urban life
	- no ceremonial ball-court
	- no great tombs
		- tunnels under [[pyramids_of_the_sun_and_the_moon]], and [[Temple of the Feathered Serpent]] lead to weird other-worlds (labyrinths, shrines) and not sacred ruler graves

#subchapter *in which we first consider an example of stranger-kings in the Maya lowlands, and their affiliation with Teotihuacan (pp 333-337)*

## 3. Urban areas don't need hierarchy to hold them together: evidence: Teotihuacan

### 3.1. evidence: Maya stranger-kings

- setting the scene:
	- tropical forest kingdoms of the Classic Maya, in the east, in [[Yucatán Peninsula]]
	- 400-500 ad (5th century ad)
	- Maya city-states at the time:
		- [Tikal](Tikal.md)
	- modern day Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador

- art and writing
	- monuments have intricately carved scenes of (foreign) [Teotihuacan](Teotihuacan.md)-style dress and weaponry[^1]
- actual burials of stranger-kings at base of a temple at [[Copán]]
	- individuals described as coming from the [[Land of the Cattail Reeds]]

- strange:
	- why are there images of what appear to be Teotihuacano lords on thrones in Tikal, when there are no similar images of lords sitting on thrones at Teotihuacan itself?[^2]
		- were these individuals, the seated kings, really from central Mexico (ie  [Teotihuacan](Teotihuacan.md)). possibilities:
			- (actually) local lords who liked "exotica" (and was far enough away for Teotihaucan to be seen like a Shangri-la)
				- Maya "grandees"[^3] did
					- like to dress in Teotihuacan warrior gear
					- see visions of Teotihuacan spirits during rituals
					- styles themselves "Lords and Ladies of the West"
			- complication: more than just that!
				- people did go back and forth,[^4] for trade both ways (obsidian, green quetzal feathers)), pilgrimages, diplomatic missions, (religions or missionary?) immigration
					- of the long-distance trade routes specifically
						- full of "unscrupulous characters"[^5]
						- "adventurous travellers" who are taken into an alien society and made kings;[^6] aka [stranger-kings](stranger-kings.md)[^7] († is this what happened?)
	- how could Teotihuacan ever have mounted a successful military expedition against a kingdom over 600 miles away?
		- impossible on logistical grounds (most likely)

- stranger-kings at Tikal
	- know some names and associates
		- Sihyaj K'ahk' ("Born of Fire")
	- lives before becoming royals
		- very "colorful": fight, travel, more fighting
		- may not have been from central mexico but somewhere else entirely
		- conclusion: were likely "members of groups that *specialize* in long-distance travel",[^8] eg traders, soldiers of fortune, missionaries, spies[^9]

- more recent analog:
	- central Mexican influence at [[Chichén Itzá]], " whose Temple of the Warriors seems to be directly modelled on the Toltec capital of Tula (a later Tollan)"

- implications:
	> a feeling among the Maya that kings really should come from somewhere far away, and with the willingness of at least a few unscrupulous foreigners to take advantage of this idea.[^10]
  - evidence from Tikal "tell[s] us more about Maya concepts of royal power than they do about Teotihuacan itself"
	  - that is, no (good) evidence of kingship at Teotihuacan at all has been found
  - these stranger-kings were doing in the Maya lowlands what they weren't allowed to do at home

- general conclusions:
	- so we know Teotihuacan was not a monarchy
	- we don't know what it was (for 500 years)
	- there's no single answer to what it was, and that's ok

### 3.2. evidence: the New Teotihuacan

#subchapter *how the people of Teotihuacan turned their backs on monument-building and human sacrifice, and instead embarked on a remarkable project of social housing (p 337-345)*

- an 8 square mile recorded build environment

- it can be looked at with all time collapsed into single image, which is misleading if harmonious
	- center: grand monuments ( two pyramids, Ciudadela, temple of feathered serpent)
	- around:  smaller, impressive residences on orthogonal grid, aligned to ceremonial center of city
	- problems:
		- constructed at different times
		- temple not what it seems

- for answers: try to construct chronological sequence
	- 0 ad: "growth to urban dimensions"
		- people fleeing natural disasters in the south (earthquakes, volcanoes)
	- 50-150 ad
		- people leave surrounding areas and come to Teotihuacan
		- (folk memories of "mass exodus" were available until conquistadors)
			- [[Bernardino de Sahagún]]: recounts tradition of the city being founded by elders and priests from other places; the growing city soon had "village ancestors" coexisting next to the urban deities
	- call this "Old City" (100-200 ad)
		- parish system: local shrines for local neighborhoods
		- this layout was a small version of the layout of the city as a whole

- a lot is still unclear:
	> how far the various sectors of the urban economy were integrated at this time, and how exactly resources were pulled in from a wider hinterland, is altogether unclear.[^11]

#### 3.2.1. civic identity

##### 3.2.1.1. social housing

- attempts to create "civic identity"
	- first: build monuments ("sacred city" in urban sprawl)
		- requires thousands of laborers to create this new, central landscape, including Pyramid-mountains, artificial rivers[^12]
		- ritual killing also attended each major building phase (at least hundreds); bodies in pits or trenches, symmetrically, like the foundations of the buildings on top of them
			- Sun Pyramid: infants
			- Moon Pyramid: foreign captives, mutilated
			- Temple of FEathered Serpent: male warriors
- (brings us up to about 200 ad)
	- [^13] expect Teotihuacan to become like one of the "classic" Mesoamerican societies, with "strong traditions of warrior aristocracy and city-states governed by hereditary nobles.""
	- however, what actually happened was that a ton of "high-quality" apartments were constructed (like a full-city social housing project)
- now at 300 ad ("fortunes" change)
	- Temple of Feathered Serpent looted, desecrated, burned, smashed, and obscured by a platform built later
	- all pyramid construction stopped permanently
	- no more ritual killing evidence at Pyramids of Sun and Moon (still used until 550 ad)
	- (instead) stone-built housing for basically the entire population
		- probably not innovation from this period; most likely started 100 years earlier
		- may have started as palaces in 200, since they're so nice, but after 300 ad built for everyone (100k people)

- what were the houses like?
	- small groups of nuclear families
	- single-story buildings
	- drainage facilities
	- plastered floors and walls
	- private porticoes
	- set within apartment "compounds" of about 100 people
		- central courtyard
		- domestic rituals
		- altars with murals
		- (small) pyramid-shaped shrines[^14]
		- strict uniformity was avoided, although each block was made to similar dimensions
	- [[René Millon]] characterized it as "invented as a form of social housing" for a crowded city

- how did this happen?
	- few signs of violence (other than against Temple of Feathered Serpent)
	- land and resources allocated to family groups, who then became neighbors
	- multi-ethnic city

- life
	- two kinds of communal life within a 60-100 person complex:
		- kinship (family ties extend beyond apartment block and even the city)
		- co-residence, reinforced by shared craft specializations (garment-making, obsidian working)
	- human scale maintained (unlike mcmansions)

- what held it together (that is, if not a hereditary elite or governing class?)[^15]
	- can rule out top-down system (like royal admins or priests)
	- probably: local assemblies, answered to governing council (aka community associations)
		- "three-temple complexes" (district shrines), about one for every 100 blocks
		- and, primary sources from later cities from Spanish conquest time make it seem quite possible situations like this persevered for hundreds of years

##### 3.2.1.2. mural art (w/r/t civic identity)

- ad 350 and on
- "playful pictorial scenes"
	- psychedelic; people doing psychedelic drugs and tripping; figures are all the same size (compared to one another)
		- (of course, this is just how they liked to imagine themselves)
		- complex reality:
			- (in specific neighborhood: [[Teopancazco]]) inhabitants lead affluent lives
				- Gulf Coast trading
				- Gulf Coast violent rituals, tho (enemy heads kept in jars)
- by 550 ad
	- because of "social tensions simmering away" (like differences of head-in-jar people), city starts to come apart socially
	- no foreign invasion
	- city's population disperses rapidly

##### 3.2.1.3. transition

we can't just see this as a blip on a one-way road:

> “Should we view the whole episode as a passing deviation, a blip (albeit an extremely large blip) on the road that led from Olmec hierarchy to Toltec aristocracy and eventually Aztec imperialism? Or might the egalitarian aspects of Teotihuacan have a distinct legacy of their own?”[^16]

#subchapter *on the case of [Tlaxcala](Tlaxcala.md), an indigenous republic that resisted the Aztec Empire then came to join forces with Spanish invaders, and how its fateful decision emerged from democratic deliberations in an urban parliament (as opposed to the dazzling effects of European technology on ‘Indian minds’) (pp 346-358)*

## 4. [head]

### 4.1. Tlaxcala was a "functioning urban democracy"

- indigenous city-state
- adjacent to (nowaday) [Puebla](Puebla.md)

#### 4.1.1. disagreement with Charles C Mann's account

(† assumed)
- Mann asserts (well, presumes) that Tlaxcala had kings and kingdoms
- problem with this account
	- no kings in Tlaxcala, so describing it as a "confederation of kingdoms" couldn't be correct
	- so:
		- why did Mann think there were (kings and kingdoms)?
			- at the mercy of 2ndary sources, since he's a science journalist, not a history specialist
			- he would have assumed that, if it were not a kingdom, the 2ndary lit would have talked about that (for instance, if it were a republic, democracy, or oligarchy). this is not the case, though

##### 4.1.1.1. comparing 2ndary lit to other sources

###### 4.1.1.1.1. Cortés

- In [Five letters of relation (1519-1526)](five_letters_of_relation.md) Cortés describes Tlaxcala as being like a thriving italian republic
- a caution: Cortés only a minor aristocrat, probably had "little real knowledge of republics"
	- but: by 1519 undoubtedly was good at taxonomy of Mesoamerican kings
		- he couldn't find any in [Tlaxcala](Tlaxcala.md)
		- engaged with reps of urban council, where all decisions were collectively ratified

- obviously Cortés couldn't have defeated Aztec Empire without the help of 20,000 Tlaxcala warriors
- so: why did [Tlaxcalteca](Tlaxcalteca.md) decide to join him?
	- settle old scores:
		- end to fights with [Aztec Triple Alliance](Tripartite%20Alliance.md) and [[Flowery Wars]] between [[Valley of Puebla]] and [[Valley of Mexico]]
		- sources mostly from Aztec elites, who would obviously have an interest in downplaying the real threat Tlaxcalteca posed
			- actually, Tlaxcala and its [[Otomí guerilla units]] had resisted Aztecs for generations; this resistance was military but also an ethos directly opposed to emergence of leaders and Aztec-style social structure

- that is, [Tenochtitlan](Tenochtitlan.md) and [Tlaxcala](Tlaxcala.md) were polar opposites in terms of ideals[^17]
	- however, we know almost nothing about this
		- because the defeat of Tenochtitlan is treated like manifest destiny not requiring an explanation
			- (importantly, not the "divine destiny" Cortés had in mind, but Old World agents of destruction (the guns germs steel), but also "modern industrial democracy"[^18] which the New World could never have achieved without invasion)
		- many of primary sources have never appeared in translation until recently

###### 4.1.1.1.2. how did the deliberations go (aka let's take the Crónica seriously)

- how did decisions about whether or not to ally with Cortés go?
	- Cholula: schism between half of 6 urban words, 3 taken hostage by other half (the hostage ones wanted to ally and went to Tlaxcala)
	- writing on Tlaxcala:
		- [[Bernal Díaz]]
		- [[Diego Muñoz Camargo]]
		- [[Toribio of Benavente]]
		- [Francisco Cervantes de Salazar](francisco_cervantes_de_salazar.md) and the [cronica_de_la_nueva_españa](cronica_de_la_nueva_españa.md)
			- despite some objections from scholars, it doesn't fall into the [Western arrogance](Western%20arrogance) bucket; rich descriptions of people and institutions; don't sound like classical sources, which it would have if he was writing just his sublimated training; corroborated by first-hand accounts
			- it's basically ignored, or considered example of early [[Catholic humanism]]
				- example of [[subtle_snobbery]] (to match our Western Arrogance above)
			- † but: (making case that the recorded discussions are exactly that)
				- shows a bit of indigenous collective government

###### 4.1.1.1.3. Motolinía

[[Motolinía]]
[[Historia de los Indios de la Nueva España (1541)]]
- confirms, like Cortés, that Tlaxcala an indigenous republic governed by[^19] council of elected officials[^20]
	- don't know how office selection went, or who was eligible
	- we do know "political training and instruction", though
		- the **ordeals**
			- if you wanted to be on the council, you had to go about it in self-deprecation or even shame[^21]
				- subject to trials: exposed to abuse ("proper reward for ambition"), then isolation, fasting, sleep deprivation, bloodletting, and moral instruction[^22]
				- then "coming out" with a celebration
			- reminders to cultivate Chichimec qualities[^23] 
- ‡ to the "city has to be agrarian" argument??: 
	- Tlaxcalteca saw own political values coming from desert, not farming or commerce
	- claimed descent from [[Chichimec]]

###### 4.1.1.1.4. mimesis?

##### 4.1.1.2. archaeological findings; confirmation of indigenous republic
- also confirm Tlaxcala organized different from Tenochtitlan
	- no
		- palace
		- central temple
		- major ball-court
	- yes:
		- well-appointed citizen residences
		- uniformly high standards
		- 20 or more district plazas, up on grand earthen terraces
- importantly, this was *before* Cortés ever showed up

#### 4.1.2. transition
- Tlaxcala political traditions not an "anomaly" or "blip"
- trend of urban development back ("in outline") to Teotihuacan urban experiments 1kya
- Tlaxcala "at least as much a part of [Teotihacan's] legacy as the Aztec capital"

" p 349; again: As we’ve also seen, this way of reading history would have been quite alien to Enlightenment philosophers, who were more inclined to think their ideals of freedom and equality owed much to the peoples of the New World and were by no means certain if those ideals were at all compatible with industrial advance.

[^22]: > Clearly, taking up office in this indigenous democracy required personality traits very different to those we take for granted in modern electoral politics. On this latter point, it is worth recalling that ancient Greek writers were well aware of the tendency for elections to throw up charismatic leaders with tyrannical pretensions. This is why they considered elections an aristocratic mode of political appointment, quite at odds with democratic principles; and why for much of European history the truly democratic way of filling offices was assumed to be by lottery.
