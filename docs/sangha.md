# sangha
Buddhist monasteries
Unanimous consensus required of monks.
(They have also been varying degrees of hierarchical, too, with some being "very")


“The word sangha was actually first used for the popular assemblies that governed many South Asian cities in the Buddha’s lifetime – roughly the fifth century bc – and early Buddhist texts insist that the Buddha was himself inspired by the example of these republics, and in particular the importance they accorded to convening full and frequent public assemblies.
