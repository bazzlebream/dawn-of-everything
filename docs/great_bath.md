# Great Bath

of the [Upper Citadel](Upper%20Citadel.md) in [Mohenjo Daro](mohenjo_daro.md)

> “a large sunken pool measuring roughly forty feet long and over six feet deep, lined with carefully executed brickwork, sealed with plaster and bitumen and entered on either side via steps with timber treads – all constructed to the finest architectural standards, yet unmarked by monuments dedicated to particular rulers, or indeed any other signs of personal aggrandizement.”[^1]
