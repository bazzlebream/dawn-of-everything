# Yanomami
- Amazon rainforest indigenous population
	- border of Venezuela and northern Brazil
- grow plantains and cassava
- reputation as "violent savages", 

## 1. why do they have this reputation?
- called "fierce people" by primary ethnographer, [[Napoleon Chagnon]], in 1968 book [[Yanomam√∂: The First People]]
	- dramatic images and anecdoes
	- fild [[The Ax Fight]] - vivid glimpse of tribal warfare
- however, statistics show their homicide rates are "average to low" compared to other Amerindian groups

## 2. assessing Chagnon
- he never claimed Yanomami were living fossils
- in fact, he noted that they obviously weren't "living remnants of the Stone Age"
- but, oddly, he defined them negatively^[ie. by what they lacked] rather than positively
	- written language
	- police force
	- formal judiciary
- defining them negatively effectively made them look like prototypical primitives
- his central thesis:
	- adult Yanomani men achieve advantages (cultural and reproductive) by killing other adult men
	- feedback between violence and biological vitness, **if**^[[Dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md): this is a big "if", p 16 ] it were representative of early humans, might have had evolutionary consequences
- despite whether or not there was professional misconduct, his defenders were so strong that he
	- was considered epitome of rigorous, scientific anthropology
	- all who questioned his social Darwinism were condemned as Marxists, etc
