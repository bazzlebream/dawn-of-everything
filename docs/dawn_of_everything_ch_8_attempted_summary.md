# Dawn of Everything: Ch 8: Imaginary Cities (summary)

## terminology

- **culture spheres**
	- aka **interaction areas**
	- the imaginary social group spanning vast territories, and even language groups
	- qv. [Hopewell Interaction Sphere](hopewell_interaction_sphere.md)
- **play farming**
	- [ • • •]
- on **groups** vs **societies**
	- foragers live in small **groups**, but not in small-scale **societies**

# attempted summary

[dawn_of_everything_ch_08_Imaginary_Cities_summary](dawn_of_everything_ch_08_Imaginary_Cities_summary.md) is here

- keep in mind: [Canetti's theory of invisible crowds](canetti_theory_invisible_crowds.md)
	- large social units exist imaginarily,[^2] both before and after they are a reality
	- people who live in cities treat the cities like these imaginary social structures; this way of looking at things is cognitively attested
		-"self-conscious statements of civic unity"
		- "sons or daughters" of city
			- even if migrated fro far away
		- civic festivals: imaginary structures become tangible
- "urban life doesn't imply a particular form of political organization"
	- the [theory of scaffolding](theory%20of%20scaffolding.md) is wrong, because evidence does not support the notion that it does ("imply …")
	- the [the problem of scale](the%20problem%20of%20scale.md) is a fake problem the way it is phrased
		- partly because it confuses size of group you live in, with scale of society you life in
		- society is as big as the imaginary structures spanning huge territories
	*- population size does matter, though, just not in [the problem of scale](the%20problem%20of%20scale.md) way??*
- look, we're going to be counting as cities that aren't called cities ("mega-sites", "overgrown villages")
	- please see our justification for this

## why did early cities form

- (aka not because of a grain surplus)
- (aka not because seasonal aggregation sites became permanent)
- #point these cities are older than admin and authoritarian government (which can no longer be assumed to be necessary)
- maybe
	- environmental disasters push people together
		- [Teotihuacan](Teotihuacan.md)
	- stable deltaic environments because of Holocene attracted large human populations
		- Shangdong on Yellow River
		- [[Rio_Supe]]
		- Maya lowlands
	- flatlands soil formation ([chernozem](chernozem.md))

## once cities formed, how did they stay together?

- physical realizations of (pre-existing) extended community
	- eg the Ukraine sites and the [Cucuteni-Tripolyte culture](Cucuteni-Tripolyte%20culture.md)
	- often even looks like a process of contraction[^3] (so no great "psychological rupture")
- eco-consciousness (no destruction of the material conditions of their way of life)
	- (i think this belongs to "why did they stay together")
- civic festivals?
- united devotion to something

## egalitarianism is not simple

- egalitarianism does not mean simple : see complexities below
	- premise: these places were egalitarian
	- food and industries organization (complex logistics)
	- surplus without warfare (complex strategies)
	- complex housing arrangements
		- evidence: all houses unique but also common plan
		- evidence: even neighborhoods unique but common plan
			- each neighborhood access to assembly houses (not food prep or tools, so not factories)
		- evidence: etc districts, quarters
	- scheduling things when everyone has cross-cutting obligations, and sometimes households can't do it
	- mutual aid that's intricate

## how were complex decisions made

- complex decision-making, how:
	- a kind of gardening corvee
	- (how to explain uniformity of housing and architectural)
		- implies: shared (mental) framework
			- framework could be: concentric circles
		- ok, but how realized at scale?
			- well, possible they did it like Basque, where mathematical principles and cosmologies allowed it to grow from there?
	- duties
		- math
- so, what's been called simple (because no central control) was actually complex, as above, and probably one of the reasons being no central control
	- [move this?] no reason to assume these techniques only work on small scale, either

[zw] - it perhaps seems like they rely on "uniformity" needing an explanation in the absence of centralized control that it acts as a kind of accidental part of a proof for how they must have been complex (to reproduce that uniformity)

??? why???

then they try to figure out what government in Mesopotamian cities was like before kings appeared

- well, we know there were popular councils and assemblies
	- (un-define "primitive democracy" to show that it was complex democracy (before kings) )
- but how they functioned could mean anything (for egalitarianism or not)
	- (historians) the very lack of evidence to how they functioned shows it couldn't have been in cooperation with a central administration, since there's no paperwork
	- (archaeologists) 3 cases to show urbanites were self-governing
		- even distribution of wealth, no obvious centers of power
		- when authoritarians come in, people leave
		- emperor hears from lieutenants-at-large, like, if I say i'm from the government they're like "fuck off dude"
- but we still don't have an answer as to nature of government?
	- Uruk: Before royal rule, separate, raised temple sector comprised of the needy working various factories to produce consistently packaged and labeled goods
