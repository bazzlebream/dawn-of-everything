# Christopher Boehm

essence of our humanity is that we are self-conscious political actors:

> while humans do have an instinctual tendency to engage in dominance-submissive behaviour, no doubt inherited from our simian ancestors, *what makes societies distinctively human* is our ability to make the conscious decision not to act that way. ^[G&W paraphrase, [Dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md) p 86]

humans have tactics to ground would-be dominators:

> a whole panoply of tactics collectively employed to bring would-be braggarts and bullies down to earth – ridicule, shame, shunning (and in the case of inveterate sociopaths, sometimes even outright assassination)19 – none of which have any parallel among other primates.^[ibid.]
