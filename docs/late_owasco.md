# Late Owasco

late owasco phase, from ad 1230 to 1375, when people began to move away from their previous settlements (and from their earlier patterns of seasonal mobility) along waterways, settling in palisaded towns occupied all year around in which longhouses, presumably based in matrilineal clans, became the predominant form of dwelling. many of these towns were quite substantial, containing as many as 2,000 inhabitants (that is, something approaching a quarter of the population of central cahokia).[^1]
