# cronica_de_la_nueva_españa

- sections of governing council of Tlaxcala
- deliberations over whether to ally with Spanish invaders
	- he describes the "workings of […] a mature urban parliament" (ie *not* a royal court)[^1]
	- consensus arguments would go on for weeks
	- Book 3:
		- [Cortés](hernan_cortes.md) still outside city with Totonac allies
		- ambassadors go back and forth between him and Tlaxcala city council
		- [[Maxixcatzin]], a "lord" asks everyone to ally with Cortés against Aztecs
		- [[Xicotentacl the Elder]] (over 100!) intervenes: this will make an "enemy within", which is the gardest thing to resist; they're going to make us slaves
		- a creative synthesis proposed
			- basically an ambush to test Cortés
