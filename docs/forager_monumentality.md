# 1. in which we show how new discoveries concerning ancient hunter-gatherers in north america and japan are turning social evolution on its head (141-148)

- the vibrant and complex history of nonagricultural peoples after the Ice Age
- #theme (explaining) Why don't people include it in discussions on the origins of urban life, centralization, and the historical consequences?
- #theme Why aren't these sites better known?
- an archaeological embarrassment that things were happening during this period, since it had been written off

## 1. "built spaces where hunter-gatherer publics once assembled in their thousands"

- Poverty Point
	- The lack of an agricultural base does not seem to have stopped those who gathered on [Poverty Point](poverty_point.md) from creating something that to us would appear very much like little cities which, at least during certain times of year, hosted a rich and influential intellectual life.[^13]
- [[U-shaped amphitheatres of St Johns River valley in Northeast Florida]]
- [[British Columbia settlements and fortifications from 2000 bc]]

## 2. Written-off periods of history: forager monumentality

**globally attested phenomenon of [[forager monumentality]]**
- "changes the nature of the conversation about social evolution"
	- but this knowledge is still not integrated
	- people still act as if it were impossible before agriculture

- in the so-called [Archaic](Archaic.md) phase of American prehistory (8000 -1000 bc)
	- (although now the term [[New Archaic]] is tentatively being used of an era of "monuments without kings")
- [Jomon](jomon.md) in Japan and nearby islands
	- an entirely different picture of what society was like before irrigated rice cultivation came to Japan from the Korean Peninsula[^14]
- Europe
