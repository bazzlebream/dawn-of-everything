aka zw: "what we should probably mean by 'egalitarianism'"

[[James_Woodburn]]
- authority on [[hunter-gatherer egalitarianism]]
- researched societies (forager and nomadic forager societies)
	- [Hadza](east_african_hadza.md)
		- apply "principles of equality" to basically everything
	- [[san_bushmen]]
	- [[mbuti_pygmies]]
	- [[Pandaram]] of south India
	- [[Batek]] of Malaysia
- concludes:
	- they are "the only genuinely egalitarian societies we know of, since they extend equality to gender relations and (as much as practicable) old and young"
	- this behavior based on self-conscious ethos that no one should be in relation of ongoing dependency to anyone else[^2]
		- echoes [Boehm](boehm_christopher.md)'s notion of [actuarial intelligence](actuarial_intelligence.md)
		- (and Woodburn also [actuarial intelligence](actuarial_intelligence.md) in the sense that Hadza et al understood this, and self-consciously avoid stockpiling or long-term projects)
		- but with Woodburn twist: the *real* defining feature of such societies is "the lack of any material surplus" [^3]
		- aka truly egalitarian societies:
			- those with [immediate return economies](immediate_return_economies.md)
			- contrasted to: [delayed return economies](delayed_return_economies.md)
				- where these *investments* **inevitably** lead to ongoing ties, that become basis for exercising power

- did not address:
	- what is being equalized, exactly
	- #undeveloped ? still ??

- Woodburn's view is not optimistic
	- Rousseau's savages rush blindly for their chains
	- Woodburn's [immediate_return_hunter-gatherers](immediate_return_hunter-gatherers.md) understand what could happen and explicitly try to keep that at bay
		- implies that any "true" equality is impossible for all but simplest foragers
		- it's the [Garden of Eden narrative](garden_of_eden_narrative.md), but with bar for paradise set higher (have to be immediate return hunter-gathers ?)

# 2.1. recasting egalitarianism as both freedom (autonomy) and the systems of mutual aid which make it possible

At first glance it looks like the First Nation critics, such as [Kandiaronk](Kandiaronk.md), must have defined "egalitarianism" differently from the forager and nomadic forager societies studied by Woodburn. Specifically, Kandiaronk et al "had trouble imagining that differences of wealth" could result in a hierarchical situation, whereas Woodburn's forager societies intentionally arranged their social activities to prevent such a situation.

Fortunately, there is a deeper unity to the viewpoints of the First Nations societies and the forager societies. They were both concerned about "substantive" freedoms,[^4] individual autonomy,[^5] and the reciprocal systems of obligation and mutual aid which made those freedoms possible.

Substantive freedoms are even compatible with "play" hierarchies,[^6] where "play hierarchies" are hierarchies that are mostly theatrical and/or are restricted to limited aspects of social life.

The [Sudanese Nuer](nuer.md) present an intermediate case between "substantive freedoms with play hierarchies" and "formal freedoms with real hierarchies"[^7]

#clean-up
- more like US: the [Nuer](nuer.md), as per [Kathleen Gough](kathleen_gough.md)
- but [[E E Evans Pritchard]] also right in thinking Nuer egalitarian, since rank and differential access had almost no bearing outside arranging marriages
- however, no equality of status[^8]
- but …while rank and differential access to cattle became relevant when people were arranging marriages, they had almost no bearing in any other circumstances.
	- ( It would have been impossible, even at a formal event like a dance or sacrifice, to determine who was ‘above’ anyone else.)
- importantly, differences in wealth never [translated into the ability to give orders or demand obeisance](differences_translated_into_systematic_inequalities_of_power.md)
- gender differences?
	- "most Nuer women were not 'properly' married"
		- ghost marriage: [^9]
- "individual freedom was assumed unless there was some specific reason to curtail it"
