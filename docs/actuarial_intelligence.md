# actuarial intelligence

[Boehm](boehm_christopher.md)'s term for

the ability to "understand what their society might look like if they did things differently”, or "reflect consciously on different directions one's society could take, and make explicit arguments about the different paths"^[[Dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md) p 86]

- this is the essence of politics: the ability to reflect consciously on different directions one’s society could take, and to make explicit arguments why it should take one path rather than another.
