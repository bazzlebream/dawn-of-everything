# why this information isn't integrated



## 1. how the myth that foragers live in a state of infantile simplicity is kept alive today (or, informal fallacies) (148-153)

#theme-detail
- characterizing "not integrating" info
	- holding onto idea of carefree, idle forager bands
		- when indigenous critics would "[overstate the case that hunter-gatherers better off than europeans](overstate_the_case_that_hunter-gatherers_better_off_than_europeans.md)", it reinforced this notion for europeans
		- this idea allows Europeans to invoke the [Agricultural Argument](agricultural_argument_of_19th_century_jurists.md)
			- the Agricultural Argument doesn't even make sense on its own criteria (see the linked page)
	- civilization impossible without agriculture
		- "economic base of at least some forager societies capable of supporting" things we associate with civilization (priestly castes, royal courts with standing armies)
			- case of the [Calusa](calusa.md): Calusa were not European-style farmers (and were even foragers in the sense of "populations which donâ€™t rely on biologically domesticated plants and animals as their primary sources of food") and still clearly had priestly cases, royal courts, standing armies, which we'd usually call civilization
	- writing history as though Poverty Point "could never have existed"
- reasons for not integrating
	- whimsial result of dismissive academic terminologies, doesn't explain it really
	- real answer:
		- european colonial expansion
			- impact on indigenous and european systems of thought
				- esp w/r/t property rights of land

## 2. in which we dispose of one particularly silly argument that foragers who settle in territories that lend themselves well to foraging are somehow unusual (153-156)

- #theme Ways of propping up the myth of the [Agricultural Revolution](agricultural_revolution.md)
	- the [the 'all the bad spots are taken!' argument](atypical_environment_claim.md)
		- and the Calusa actually weren't atypical, as one of many fisher-forager populations around [[Straits of Florida]] with whom they fought, traded, and dynastic-married
			- [[Tequesta]]
			- [[Pojoy]]
			- [[Jeaga]]
			- [[Jobe]]
			- [[Ais]]
	- it's even possible that this can be excused since most of the evidence is underwater, but clearly people came to the Americas in 17,000 at least using boats, the coast, and [[kelp highways]], staying there and forming dense and stable settlements, and less often moving eastward over the continent and settling in or traversing less foodstuffs-rich environments.
