# IN WHICH WE ASK WHAT, PRECISELY, IS EQUALIZED IN ‘EGALITARIAN’ SOCIETIES?

( I think [Wrong About (Almost) Everything](wrong_about_almost_everything_chris_knight.md) treats of this section in [[tiny hunter gatherer bands]])

zw: why do they start this way?

- likelihood of getting stuck increases with:
	- [[Mesolithic]] [[local cultural worlds]]
		- self-contained society abandons seasonal dispersal and settles into hierarchical arrangement permanently

- that's just probability, though
- why (reasons, causes?) did it actually happen

- “origins of social inequality”
	- what does inequality mean
	- what does "[[egalitarian society]]" mean
	- [["how egalitarian" dilemma]]
		- solutions:
			- [[universal equality standard]]
				- historically: [[means of subsistence]] standard
					- led to: treat hunter-gatherers as distinct variety of humans
					- combined with [[Roussea's theory of the origins of inequality]] (agriculture)
					- combined with [[Rousseau's theory of the origin of the state]] (material surplus)
					- (it's the "inexorability" here that DoE argues against)

- yes, agriculture[^1] is a necessary [[condition of possibility]] of bureaucratic regimes like "Pharaonic Egypt, Maurya Empire, Han China"
- **but, agriculture didn't *cause* those states**
	- 6000 years between first middle east farmers and rise of those "states"
	- in many parts of world, farming *never* led to emergence of anything like those states

## mini-summation
why did we get stuck with domination?
- historical attempt to define egalitarian
- attempt to rank egalitarianism
- development of a universal equality standard
- use means of subsistence as a standard
- ??
- agriculture leads to inequality, according to Rousseau
- material surplus leads to the state, according to Rousseau
- this is inexorable

let's change this to:
- agriculture is a necessary condition of possibility for bureaucratic regimes like "Pharaonic Egypt, Maurya Empire, Han China"
- agriculture is not an inexorable cause of states like that

?? why did we start with the density thing?

## back to the book

- [[notion of a surplus]]
	- questions about what it means to be human
		- [I can't tell if they are agreeing with or teeing up this:] animals produce only and exactly what they need; humans produce more (creatures of excess)
	- ruling classes are just the ones that take it for themselves
	- marx thought this surplus could be distributed collectively
	- contemporary thinkers are more sceptical
	- dominant anthro view: only way to egalitarian society is eliminate even possibility of surplus

## section break

aka zw: "what we should probably mean by 'egalitarianism'"

[[James Woodburn]]
- authority on [[hunter-gatherer egalitarianism]]
- the societies he researched are "the only genuinely egalitarian societies we know of, since they extend equality to gender relations and (as much as practicable) old and young"
	- this behavior based on self-conscious ethos that no one should be in relation of ongoing dependency to anyone else[^2]
	- echoes [Boehm](boehm_christopher.md)'s [actuarial intelligence](actuarial_intelligence.md)
		- but with Woodburn twist: the *real* defining feature of such societies is "the lack of any material surplus"
	- truly egalitarian societies: those with [immediate return economies](immediate_return_economies.md)
		- (contract to [[delayed return economies]], like foragers, farmers, pastoralists, who *invest* energies in projects bearing fruit in the future)
			- Woodburn argues these *investments* **inevitably** lead to ongoing ties, that become basis for exercising power
			- Woodburn assumes [actuarial intelligence](actuarial_intelligence.md), that Hadza et al understood this, and self-consciously avoid stockpiling or long-term projects
			- [[immediate return hunter-gatherers]]
				- DoE: implies that any equality worth the name is impossible for all but simplest foragers
				- it's the [[Garden of Eden narrative]], but with bar for paradise set higher (have to be immediate return hunter-gathers ?)

?? do we get to this?
- since he just looked at these societies, he could avoid question: [[what is being equalized]]

### tangent: first nation critics of europeans
p 129

**trouble imagining [[differences of wealth translated into systematic inequalities of power]]**

**indigenous critique started as perceived failure to promote mutual aid and protect personal liberties** (only later did it focus on inequalities of property)

so look at:

problem with term "egalitarian societies"
alternatives:
**autonomy**
- [Eleanor Leacock](leacock_eleanor.md)
	- autonomy: make decisions without interference
- DoE: so the value to be distributed equally ([universal equality standard](universal%20equality%20standard.md)) is "freedom"
	- so we should call these "free societies", or "free people"
- formal freedoms vs real freedoms
	- Wendat had play chiefs and real freedoms
	- while US has real chiefs and play freedoms
- "real" = "substantive" (def: possibility of actually doing that freedom; which is why it's phrased as "obligation" to provide that possibililty for others); mutual aid was necessary condition for individual "autonomy"
- these societies concerned with "substantive" freedoms

- hierarchies can emerge, but if they are theatrical, or confined to limited aspects of social life, you could still say "egalitarian", under this idea
	- more like US: the Nuer, as per [[Kathleen Gough]]
		- but [[E E Evans Pritchard]] also right in thinking Nuer egalitarian, since rank and differential access had almost no bearing outside arranging marriages
		- importantly, differences in wealth never [translated into the ability to give orders or demand obeisance](differences%20of%20wealth%20translated%20into%20systematic%20inequalities%20of%20power.md) 
		- ghost marriage: [^3]

## mini-summation

rather than Woodburn's idea of egalitarianism as lack of material surplus, we should think of it as substantive freedoms, autonomy, and mutual obligation (for the values thought important?), even if hierarchies do exist, as long as they are theatrical or segregated

## section break

*Victorians try to convince everyone that everyone in the past worked even harder, and that things were going to slowly get better, until everyone was just leisure and affluence due to production increases*

- real puzzle (sub puzzle of getting stuck) is not when the hierarchies appeared (because they could still be theatrical or segregated) but when you couldn't just laugh them away

a doesn't necessarily lead to b

- turgot and smith
- technological progress prime mover
- liberation from toil was the goal
- campaigns to get 8 hour day
- counter campaign: primitive man was always struggling, so be glad you just have this! (we're just arguing about pace)
	- accepted as common sense 1900ish
- [[The original affluent society]] then came around

?? not sure we finished the logic of the previous section



[^1]: cereal farming, grain storage, etc
[^2]: i believe in [[Debt]] Graeber says that hierarchy is one-sided giving (or two-sided, but when the things given are not similar) that becomes permanent (ie ongoing)
[^3]: “the complexities of the system were such that a large proportion found themselves officially married to ghosts, or to other women (who could be declared male for genealogical purposes) – in which case, how they went about becoming pregnant and raising their children was nobody’s business but their own.” p 132
