[[section break (132-134)]]

In the 1960's, with the publication of [The original affluent society](The_original_affluent_society.md) [Marshall Sahlins](marshall_sahlins.md) blows apart the truistic [struggle for existence](struggle_for_existence.md) depiction of prehistoric societies. He suggests, instead, that prehistoric societies were actually materially abundant and still had at least half their time for what we'd call leisure. He also cautioned (though this is often overlooked) that the ways of life of the particular societies he examined were not necessarily representative. This implies that, before agriculture, humans had tens of thousands of years to experiment with all sorts of modes of societal organizations, including wildly different "affluent" kinds: at least as diverse as those represented in the ethnological sources.

This was really just an echo of what indigenous critics had said as early as the 16th century (1500s): Hunter-gatherers were materially better off than others because it was so easy to get what they wanted and needed.[^10]

#theme

Again, there is no truly original state of affairs.[^11] What needs to be explained is how that flexibility was lost and we became fixed in "permanent relations of dominance and subordination".[^12]

[^2]: i believe in [[Debt]] Graeber says that hierarchy is one-sided giving (or two-sided, but when the things given are not similar) that becomes permanent (ie ongoing)
[^3]: “the complexities of the system were such that a large proportion found themselves officially married to ghosts, or to other women (who could be declared male for genealogical purposes) – in which case, how they went about becoming pregnant and raising their children was nobody’s business but their own.” p 132
[^4]: Unnecessarily extracted to [Woodburn's definition of truly egalitarian societies](woodburn_s_definition_of_truly_egalitarian_societies.md)
[^5]: This (I think) can also mean "play kings" or "play rulers", although hierarchies are not the same as sovereignty, which (I believe) is the constitutive form of social domination specific to kings and rulers.
[^6]: Graeber and Wengrow introduce autonomy through [Eleanor Leacock](leacock_eleanor.md), going on to say that the value to be distributed equally (under the [universal equality standard](universal_equality_standard.md) train of thought) is "freedom", suggesting that, instead of "egalitarian societies", we should call these "free societies", or "free people"
[^7]: see [formal vs substantive freedoms](formal_vs_substantive_freedoms.md)
[^9]: (And these are already moderated versions of the extremes.)
[^10]: (unless it be this experimental freedom??)

[^13]: > Across the Japanese archipelago, between 14,000 and 300 bc, centennial cycles of settlement nucleation and dispersal came and went; monuments shot up in wood and stone, and then were pulled down again or abandoned; elaborate ritual traditions, including opulent burials, flourished and declined; specialized crafts waxed and waned, including remarkable accomplishments in the arts of pottery, wood and lacquer. In traditions of wild food procurement, strong regional contrasts are evident, ranging from maritime adaptations to acorn-based economies, both using large storage facilities for gathered resources. Cannabis came into use, for fibres and recreational drug use. There were enormous villages with grand storehouses and what seem to be ritual precincts, such as those found at Sannai Maruyama.
[^14]: p 148
