## 1. back to the book

### 1.1. notion of a surplus

- [[notion of a surplus]]
	- questions about what it means to be human
		- [I can't tell if they are agreeing with or teeing up this:] animals produce only and exactly what they need; humans produce more (creatures of excess)
	- ruling classes are just the ones that take it for themselves
	- marx thought this surplus could be distributed collectively
	- contemporary thinkers are more sceptical
	- dominant anthropology view:
		- only way to egalitarian society is eliminate even possibility of surplus

## 2. section break

aka zw: "what we should probably mean by 'egalitarianism'"

[[James_Woodburn]]
- authority on [[hunter-gatherer egalitarianism]]
- researched societies (forager and nomadic forager societies)
	- [Hadza](east_african_hadza.md)
		- apply "principles of equality" to basically everything
	- [[san_bushmen]]
	- [[mbuti_pygmies]]
	- [[Pandaram]] of south India
	- [[Batek]] of Malaysia
- concludes:
	- they are "the only genuinely egalitarian societies we know of, since they extend equality to gender relations and (as much as practicable) old and young"
	- this behavior based on self-conscious ethos that no one should be in relation of ongoing dependency to anyone else[^2]
		- echoes [Boehm](boehm_christopher.md)'s notion of [actuarial intelligence](actuarial_intelligence.md)
		- (and Woodburn also [actuarial intelligence](actuarial_intelligence.md) in the sense that Hadza et al understood this, and self-consciously avoid stockpiling or long-term projects)
		- but with Woodburn twist: the *real* defining feature of such societies is "the lack of any material surplus" [^3]
		- aka truly egalitarian societies:
			- those with [immediate return economies](immediate_return_economies.md)
			- contrasted to: [delayed return economies](delayed_return_economies.md)
				- where these *investments* **inevitably** lead to ongoing ties, that become basis for exercising power

- did not address:
	- what is being equalized, exactly
	- #undeveloped ? still ??

- Woodburn's view is not optimistic
	- Rousseau's savages rush blindly for their chains
	- Woodburn's [immediate_return_hunter-gatherers](immediate_return_hunter-gatherers.md) understand what could happen and explicitly try to keep that at bay
		- implies that any "true" equality is impossible for all but simplest foragers
		- it's the [Garden of Eden narrative](garden_of_eden_narrative.md), but with bar for paradise set higher (have to be immediate return hunter-gathers ?)

### 2.1. recasting egalitarianism as both freedom (autonomy) and the systems of mutual aid which make it possible

At first glance it looks like the First Nation critics, such as [Kandiaronk](Kandiaronk.md), must have defined "egalitarianism" differently from the forager and nomadic forager societies studied by Woodburn. Specifically, Kandiaronk et al "had trouble imagining that differences of wealth" could result in a hierarchical situation, whereas Woodburn's forager societies intentionally arranged their social activities to prevent such a situation.

Fortunately, there is a deeper unity to the viewpoints of the First Nations societies and the forager societies. They were both concerned about "substantive" freedoms,[^4] individual autonomy,[^5] and the reciprocal systems of obligation and mutual aid which made those freedoms possible.

Substantive freedoms are even compatible with "play" hierarchies,[^6] where "play hierarchies" are hierarchies that are mostly theatrical and/or are restricted to limited aspects of social life.

The [Sudanese Nuer](nuer.md) present an intermediate case between "substantive freedoms with play hierarchies" and "formal freedoms with real hierarchies"[^7]

#clean-up
- more like US: the [Nuer](nuer.md), as per [Kathleen Gough](kathleen_gough.md)
- but [[E E Evans Pritchard]] also right in thinking Nuer egalitarian, since rank and differential access had almost no bearing outside arranging marriages
- however, no equality of status[^8]
- but …while rank and differential access to cattle became relevant when people were arranging marriages, they had almost no bearing in any other circumstances.
	- ( It would have been impossible, even at a formal event like a dance or sacrifice, to determine who was ‘above’ anyone else.)
- importantly, differences in wealth never [translated into the ability to give orders or demand obeisance](differences_translated_into_systematic_inequalities_of_power.md)
- gender differences?
	- "most Nuer women were not 'properly' married"
		- ghost marriage: [^9]
- "individual freedom was assumed unless there was some specific reason to curtail it"

#unpack
[[section break (132-134)]]

In the 1960's, with the publication of [The original affluent society](The_original_affluent_society.md) [Marshall Sahlins](marshall_sahlins.md) blows apart the truistic [struggle for existence](struggle_for_existence.md) depiction of prehistoric societies. He suggests, instead, that prehistoric societies were actually materially abundant and still had at least half their time for what we'd call leisure. He also cautioned (though this is often overlooked) that the ways of life of the particular societies he examined were not necessarily representative. This implies that, before agriculture, humans had tens of thousands of years to experiment with all sorts of modes of societal organizations, including wildly different "affluent" kinds: at least as diverse as those represented in the ethnological sources.

#out-of-sequence

This was really just an echo of what indigenous critics had said as early as the 16th century (1500s): Hunter-gatherers were materially better off than others because it was so easy to get what they wanted and needed.[^10]

- [Mi'kmaq](mi_kmaq.md)
- [Kandiaronk](Kandiaronk.md)
	- would overstate case sometimes

#theme

Again, there is no truly original state of affairs.[^11] What needs to be explained is how that flexibility was lost and we became fixed in "permanent relations of dominance and subordination".[^12]

## 3. in which we show how new discoveries concerning ancient hunter-gatherers in north america and japan are turning social evolution on its head (141-148)

- the vibrant and complex history of nonagricultural peoples after the Ice Age
- #theme (explaining) Why don't people include it in discussions on the origins of urban life, centralization, and the historical consequences?
- #theme Why aren't these sites better known?
- an archaeological embarrassment that things were happening during this period, since it had been written off

### 3.1. "built spaces where hunter-gatherer publics once assembled in their thousands"

- Poverty Point
	- The lack of an agricultural base does not seem to have stopped those who gathered on [Poverty Point](poverty_point.md) from creating something that to us would appear very much like little cities which, at least during certain times of year, hosted a rich and influential intellectual life.[^13]
- [[U-shaped amphitheatres of St Johns River valley in Northeast Florida]]
- [[British Columbia settlements and fortifications from 2000 bc]]

### 3.2. Written-off periods of history: forager monumentality

**globally attested phenomenon of [[forager monumentality]]**
- "changes the nature of the conversation about social evolution"
	- but this knowledge is still not integrated
	- people still act as if it were impossible before agriculture

- in the so-called [Archaic](Archaic.md) phase of American prehistory (8000 -1000 bc)
	- (although now the term [[New Archaic]] is tentatively being used of an era of "monuments without kings")
- [Jomon](jomon.md) in Japan and nearby islands
	- an entirely different picture of what society was like before irrigated rice cultivation came to Japan from the Korean Peninsula[^14]
- Europe
	- [Jätinkirkko](jatinkirkko.md)
	- [Big Idol](big_idol.md)
	- [amber-soaked_burials_of_karelia_and_southern_scandinavia](amber-soaked_burials_of_karelia_and_southern_scandinavia.md)
	- [Stonehenge](Stonehenge.md)

## 4. how the myth that foragers live in a state of infantile simplicity is kept alive today (or, informal fallacies) (148-153)

#theme-detail
- characterizing "not integrating" info
	- holding onto idea of carefree, idle forager bands
		- when indigenous critics would "[overstate the case that hunter-gatherers better off than europeans](overstate_the_case_that_hunter-gatherers_better_off_than_europeans.md)", it reinforced this notion for europeans
		- this idea allows Europeans to invoke the [Agricultural Argument](agricultural_argument_of_19th_century_jurists.md)
			- the Agricultural Argument doesn't even make sense on its own criteria (see the linked page)
	- civilization impossible without agriculture
		- "economic base of at least some forager societies capable of supporting" things we associate with civilization (priestly castes, royal courts with standing armies)
			- case of the [Calusa](calusa.md): Calusa were not European-style farmers (and were even foragers in the sense of "populations which don’t rely on biologically domesticated plants and animals as their primary sources of food") and still clearly had priestly cases, royal courts, standing armies, which we'd usually call civilization
	- writing history as though Poverty Point "could never have existed"
- reasons for not integrating
	- whimsial result of dismissive academic terminologies, doesn't explain it really
	- real answer:
		- european colonial expansion
			- impact on indigenous and european systems of thought
				- esp w/r/t property rights of land

## 5. in which we dispose of one particularly silly argument that foragers who settle in territories that lend themselves well to foraging are somehow unusual (153-156)

- #theme Ways of propping up the myth of the [Agricultural Revolution](agricultural_revolution.md)
	- the [the 'all the bad spots are taken!' argument](atypical_environment_claim.md)
		- and the Calusa actually weren't atypical, as one of many fisher-forager populations around [[Straits of Florida]] with whom they fought, traded, and dynastic-married
			- [[Tequesta]]
			- [[Pojoy]]
			- [[Jeaga]]
			- [[Jobe]]
			- [[Ais]]
	- it's even possible that this can be excused since most of the evidence is underwater, but clearly people came to the Americas in 17,000 at least using boats, the coast, and [[kelp highways]], staying there and forming dense and stable settlements, and less often moving eastward over the continent and settling in or traversing less foodstuffs-rich environments.

## 6. in which we finally return to the question of property, and inquire as to its relation to the sacred (156-163)

[[Early Holocene]]
- cultural universes (now becoming distinct from one another)
- in "environments of abundance" rather than scarcity
	- ie more like [Calusa](calusa.md) than [!Kung](san_bushmen.md)

- what about their political arrangements?
	- #why are we asking this here?

- surplus doesn't inevitably lead to a mini-kingdom
	- just because Calusa did it. and even then, why did it happen with them?
		- imitating more powerful neighbors
			- as seafarers, were familiar with divine monarchies like [Great Sun of the Natchez](Natchez.md) and probably [[Central American empires]]
		- just odd
		- (maybe it wasn't even really a kingdom): don't know how much power Carlos had
			- probably an in-between, like Natchez

- [[Natchez Sun]]
	- not pure **empty theater** (dead stayed dead), but not a **court-court** (a la [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] or [[Aurangzeb]]) - **somewhere just in between**
		- unlimited power in his village
		- rituals of deference
		- arbitrary executions
		- BUT limited by physical presence
- most Natchez lived outside royal village
	- royal reps not treated seriously outside it, even laughed at

## 7. transition: sacred places and private property (157)

[James Woodburn](James_Woodburn.md), with his [immediate return hunter-gatherers](immediate_return_hunter-gatherers.md), found an exception to the ethos of personal autonomy in [free societies](free_societies.md), which were the [structures of exclusion](structures_of_exclusion.md) applied to "the [[sacred]]". 

What Native Americans found so odd was that Europeans applied this concept to how they thought about human rights and freedoms:


| structure of exclusion |           |                         |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| sacred                 | linked to | supreme being           |
| private property       | sacred to | living human individual |

| society type                       | paradigm for human rights and freedoms       |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| free societies                     | personal autonomy and reciprocal obligations |
| [possessive individualism](possessive_individualism.md) societies | structure of exclusion                       |


[^2]: i believe in [[Debt]] Graeber says that hierarchy is one-sided giving (or two-sided, but when the things given are not similar) that becomes permanent (ie ongoing)
[^3]: “the complexities of the system were such that a large proportion found themselves officially married to ghosts, or to other women (who could be declared male for genealogical purposes) – in which case, how they went about becoming pregnant and raising their children was nobody’s business but their own.” p 132
[^4]: Unnecessarily extracted to [Woodburn's definition of truly egalitarian societies](woodburn_s_definition_of_truly_egalitarian_societies.md)
[^5]: This (I think) can also mean "play kings" or "play rulers", although hierarchies are not the same as sovereignty, which (I believe) is the constitutive form of social domination specific to kings and rulers.
[^6]: Graeber and Wengrow introduce autonomy through [Eleanor Leacock](leacock_eleanor.md), going on to say that the value to be distributed equally (under the [universal equality standard](universal_equality_standard.md) train of thought) is "freedom", suggesting that, instead of "egalitarian societies", we should call these "free societies", or "free people"
[^7]: see [formal vs substantive freedoms](formal_vs_substantive_freedoms.md)
[^8]: [kathleen_gough](kathleen_gough.md)
[^9]: (And these are already moderated versions of the extremes.)
[^10]: (unless it be this experimental freedom??)
[^11]: p 140
[^12]: p 144
[^13]: > Across the Japanese archipelago, between 14,000 and 300 bc, centennial cycles of settlement nucleation and dispersal came and went; monuments shot up in wood and stone, and then were pulled down again or abandoned; elaborate ritual traditions, including opulent burials, flourished and declined; specialized crafts waxed and waned, including remarkable accomplishments in the arts of pottery, wood and lacquer. In traditions of wild food procurement, strong regional contrasts are evident, ranging from maritime adaptations to acorn-based economies, both using large storage facilities for gathered resources. Cannabis came into use, for fibres and recreational drug use. There were enormous villages with grand storehouses and what seem to be ritual precincts, such as those found at Sannai Maruyama.
[^14]: p 148
