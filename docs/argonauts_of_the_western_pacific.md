# Argonauts of the Western Pacific

- "the founding text of twentieth-century ethnography"
- by [Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski](bronislaw_malinowski.md)

classic example of a [long distance interaction sphere](long-distance_interaction_spheres.md)

- in "kula chain" of [Massim Islands](massim_islands.md) off [[Papua New Guinea]]
- men canoed in dangerous conditions to exchange heirloom armshells and necklaces for each other (each imtem had a name and provenance)
- they would just hold it briefly and then pass it on to another expedition
- the heirlooms circle forever (arm-shells and necklaces go in opposite directions)
- to the men:
	- ultimate adventure
	- spreading one's name to unseen places
