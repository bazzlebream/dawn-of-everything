# immediate return hunter-gatherers

[James Woodburn](James_Woodburn.md)


- one exception to the rule that no adult could give direct orders, and that individuals shouldn't claim property 
	- sphere of ritual / sacred
		- [Hadza](east_african_hadza.md) & [[Pygmy]] groups
			- initiation into gendered cults is basis for exclusive ownership
				- ritual privileges
				- almost intellectual property
				- sacred items (see trumpets)
					- the only important and exclusive forms of property (at least in what's been called here "[free societies](free_societies.md)" aka autonomy is paramount value)
		- protected by secrecy, deception, and threat of violence
	- direct contrast to "minimization of exclusive property rights" in secular life

see [structures of exclusion](structures_of_exclusion.md)


examples:
- [[sacred trumpets]] of initiated males of Pygmy groups (similar in places of Papua New Guinea and Amazonia)
	- hidden in secret caches in forest
	- woman or children are attacked if the learn about them
	- complex game of secrets
		- taken out of hiding spots; men pretend they are spirit voices, or use in masquerade to impersonate spirits
