# Digging for Utopia - notes

[Digging for Utopia | by Kwame Anthony Appiah | The New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2021/12/16/david-graeber-digging-for-utopia/?lp_txn_id=1308687)

> They eloquently caution against assuming that what actually happened had to happen.

But they also say that that's not even what actually happened.

> Among its most arresting claims is that European intellectuals had no concept of social inequality before the seventeenth century because the concept was, effectively, a New World import.

> Graeber and Wengrow, by contrast, maintain that (allowing for embellishment) Adario and Kandiaronk were one and the same.

KAA on: the "indigenous critique":

>  Still, our understanding of the indigenous critique would have been strengthened had they tried to determine what, for its time, was and was not distinctive in this dialogue.

## Europeans did have the concept of "social inequality" before the Enlightenment, and before Kandiaronk

>  then they would have had to discard the thesis that Europeans, before the Enlightenment, lacked the concept of social inequality.

KAA: this claim is not true [[wengrow response - concept of inequality]]
- [ie plenty of Europeans before the Englishtenment did not lack the concept of social inequality - zw explicitizing implicit]
	- [Francisco de Vitoria](Francisco%20de%20Vitoria.md)] spoke about social inequality
		- and cited [[Gregory the Great]] who 
		> insisted that all men were by nature equal, and that “to wish to be feared by an equal is to lord it over others, contrary to the natural order.”
	- [[Thomas Müntzter]] in spurring on [[Great Peasants' Revolt]] references "those who lord it over you in a tyrannous way"
	-  [[Radical Reformation]] articulated "a vehement opposition to domination and to social inequality"
	-   theory and practice of [[Hutterites]], who replaced private property with "the community of goods" and subjected authority positions to elections [zw - notably not sortes]
	-   [[Montaigne essay from 1580]] commented that to the [[Tupinamba]], French King wasn't selected, and that some men had a lot of stuff and others begged, and unfortunates suffered inequality and injustice
-   why did they leave these out?
	-   perhaps they thought it would soften the apparent newness and unusualness of Kandiaronk's thoughts

## Rousseau was literal, not hypothetical, about his "how-things-turned-bad-story"
- G&W follow [Émile Durkheim](Durkheim_emile.md) in saying Rousseau was not being literal, given a certain sentence in the [[discourse_on_inequality]]
- KAA follows [[A O Lovejoy]]'s interpretation that this was a mere precaution so Rousseau didn't get attacked by religious folks
	- as evidence: [KAA paraphrasing AOL] the account is too detailed, eg metallurgy from volcano voyeurism

## Rousseau's version of human history does not have the dire political implications that Hobbes' does
- [KAA] G&W say Rousseau's version of human history (though different from TM thinking everything great until state arose) does not have the dire political implications that Hobbes' does
- [KAA] but actually Rousseau and Hobbes actually agreed on a critical point, that being, [ZW explicitizing implicit KAA]: things *weren't* great until the state
	- first, JJR and TH agrees that "in the period that directly preceded the rise of the state, things were awful"
		- TH: [[_bellum omnium contra omnes_]]
		- JJR: "black inclination to harm one another"
- [KAA concession]: yes, you could say JJR starts story earlier than TH
	- [ZW: Is he saying that, "yes, you could say that JJR is actually talking about a different 'time period' or 'stage'"]
	- [KAA takeback]: but they end up in the same place
		- [ZW: and that is?]
- [KAA] where JJR really differed is that he identified the problem as the wealthy getting a "rigged social contract" compurgated 
	- [KAA] and JJR said the solution was a better contract, not to return to foraging
		- [ZW: so did JJR think foraging and hunting *was* "happy" like KAA says?]

## the grain-to-state myth wasn't powerful enough to change people's minds about what's possible
- [KAA] G&W claim that the stages myth was invented to neutralize[^1] a presumably dangerous critique of European society from indigenous[^2]
	- [KAA paraphrasing]: and it neutralized the critique by convincing people that they couldn't live without authority

- [KAA]: i can disprove this by showing evidence of prominent social evolutionists who are not apologists for centralized authority, [zw implied]: or are specifically against it
	- the following people were some of "the greatest exponents" of the metanarrative/myth
	- yet these were all for political transformation
	- so clearly they weren't "reonciled to an impoverished status quo"
	- examples
		- [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s 
			- [[Diffusion Against Centralization]] and
			- [[Ancient Society]]: democracy, brotherhood, equality are what's the next level-up
		- [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s [[Theory of the Leisure Class]]
			- predatory barbarians replaced productive and peaceful savages
			- property rights and state power emerged from patriarchy
			- favored non-statist socialism
		- [[V Gordon Child]] ... ?
		- a socialist "leery of statism" actually advocated for social evolutionism in 1950s? when no one wanted anything to do with it [[Leslie A White]]
		- [[James C Scott]] recapitulated the cereals-to-states story, and he too was an anarchist

- [ZW]:
	- [KAA] seems to be not just cherry-picking examples, but picking examples from
		- outside the relevant time period (Enlightenment)
		- people who wrote intentionally progressive (to one degree or another) accounts
		- saying they are the "true" exponents of the myth
	- also appears to say, that if you can trace any intellectual history position to any other, it means you can use the other's position as an example of a contradictory viewpoint as though it took place in the milieu of the original intellectual history position (the Leslie A White argument)
	- but like --- what? that
		- so there's another point:
			- [ZW exp-impl: i assume G&W]: even anarchists believe in the historical truth of the myth (shows its power to convince people of history)
			- [KAA] even anarchists believe in the myth (shows its lack of power to change people's political views (of what's possible))

### side point:
- [KAA] the perplexing inference that Rousseau’s [[discourse_on_inequality]], in this account, at once promulgated the indigenous critique and smothered it.
- [ZW] ??? i don't know what to do with this

## point

[KAA concession]: even if G&W are wrong about intellectual history, they could still be right about Neolithic

[ZW par KAA]: issues with their rhetorical strategies:

- [[bifurcation fallacy]]
- [[fallacy fallacy]]
- [[absence of evidence serves as evidence of absence]]
- [[fallacy?: a claim isn't impossible means claim is true]]

- example of: "introduc[ing] a conjecture with the requisite qualifications, which then fall away"
	- [KAA para G&W]: Uruk: anything said about governance is speculation
		- [KAA para G&W]: we can only assume it didn't have monarchy (because no royal court)
		- [KAA however]: however, "no royal court" could mean all sorts of things: high-powered families, military or priestly elite, ward bosses, shifting council heads, could have ruled
		- [KAA para G&W]: then 100 pages later the bifurcation fallacy (either a royal boss or no bosses) [[Wengrow response - Mesopotamia]]

- [KAA para G&W] (below unless stated otherwise)
	- [[Taljanky]] is large in area
	- more than 1k homes
	- population [zw: "1,000 to"] over 10,000
	- why isn't it called a city instead of a megasite?
	- [ZW ex-im KAA para G&W] mere prejudice
	- [ZW ex-im KAA para G&W] let's call it a city
	- [ZW ex-im KAA para G&W] there's no proof of central admin
	- [ZW ex-im KAA para G&W] no proof of central admin means  highly egalitarian
	- highly egalitarian possible on city (urban) scale
- [KAA counters evidence] (in order to counter step above "let's call it a city") [[Wengrow response - chapman]]
	- population size
		- their source is [[John Chapman]], who says the model G&W will end up using is discredited maximalist model
		- thousand houses not occupied simultaneously
		- 9 lines of evidence
		- settlements weren't like cities
		- less a town than a festival site

- [KAA]: discordance between book and its own sources 
	- [[mohenjo_daro]]  [[Wengrow response - Kenoyer]]
		- [KAA cites G&W]: experts agree no evidence for nobility, or what recognize as "state"
			- [G&W's citation]: [[Jonathan Mark Kenoyer]]
			- [KAA] but Kenoyer actually said
				- Mohenjo Daro was governed as city-state
				- unicorn seals found all over, implies officials were using them
				- officials reinforced aspects of "Indus ruling elite"
		- [ZW para KAA argument:]
			- G&W say no evidence for state aspects
			- there actually are in their own sources (Kenoyer)
			- so why can't we call it a state?
			- and if we call it a state, then there was hierarchy and administration
			- and then it means you can't use Mohenjo Daro as example of urban settlement without hierarchy 
	- [[Mashkan-shapir]]
		- [KAA para G&W]
			- even distribution of wealth there (archaeological survey)
			- no obvious center of commercial or political power
			- their source is article by excavating archaeologists
			- article
				- [KAA] actually refers to disparities of household wealth, administrative center, with functions similar to palaces elsewhere
				- [KAA] commercial and admin centers were separate
					- [KAA para G&W]: they say this means that the place may have lacked both, which is not what the articles says
	- [Çatalhöyük](catalhoyuk.md)
		- [KAA para G&W]
			- no archae evidence that it had central authority [[Wengrow response - Catalhoyuk]]
			- is evidence that role of women recognized and honored
			- more women than men figurines = new awareness of women's status based on [...]
		- [KAA objects]
			- vast majority of figurines are of animals
			- so are the figurines really things that are empowered?
		- [KAA points out similar evidence leads to different conclusions]
			- in Catalhoyuk, naked lady figurines = women empowerment
			- in [[Bronze Age Minoan Crete]], naked male figurines = women empowerment too
		- [KAA objects]
			- also, 95% of the site hasn't been excavated, so you can't make sweeping claims about social structure

[KAA]: in general, they cherry-pick their evidence and whose conclusions they agree with
[[wengrow response - Teotihuacan]]

[KAA]:
- [ZW: he gets the title wrong] _The Dawn of History_
- [KAA]: much to say about *nature* of the state that's interesting
- [KAA] does not "stress test" mainstream prehistory well
	- aims one thing
	- what it actually does is another
[KAA]: which version of the meta narrative
- [ZW exim KAA]: G&W start out saying they don't agree with main myth, with its inexorabilities
- [KAA]: by the end they say they don't majorly disagree with the "cautious iterations" (KAA) of it
- [KAA para G&W]: we agree there are tendencies in history
- [KAA (self)]: indeed the "more reputable version" of the myth concern tendencies, not inexorabilities (making propitious conditions)
- [KAA para G&W]: yes, we are now enslaved to crops, and it's hard to imagine life without them
- [KAA para G&W]: forager societies, for the most part, tend to have less capital accum and inequality than sedentary farming ones
- [KAA para G&W]: agree that something went wrong in history
	- [KAA]: this matches POV of many evolutionists
- [KAA]: plausible insights:
	- people have bipolar impulses, regarding kings, hierarchies, cruelty and caring
- [KAA]: it's an effort to build out [[as long as humanity theory]]
	- [KAA para the theory?] humans resist as well as implement domination
	-  [KAA para the theory?]anarchist principles (self-org, voluntary assoc, mutual aid) are vital historical forces
	- [KAA]: this would be fine
	- [KAA]: but they want to also say:
		- there were cities free of rulers or rules
			- [ZW contra]:  DG would definitely not say free of rules; he might say free of "laws" -- but rules are omnipresent except in a kind of imagination chaotic play abstraction
		- [KAA contra]: but none of their examples are unambiguous (ie all their examples are ambiguous)

[KAA]: so, empirical shortcomings, but imaginative success
- its argument(s) are independent of evidence
	- [KAA para G&W] social critique references equality, but we should focus on (the three) freedoms (move, disobey, associate)

## 
> the sort of inequality we mainly fret about today is of concern to its authors only inasmuch as it clashes with freedom.

[zw]: i'm not sure that's true

## arguments against anarchism
- [[paradox of freedom to disobey]]
	- [zw confused]: what is the paradox?

- [zw confused on KAA]: what in the world does "worst" mean here: 

> And the worst argument to make against anarchism—against a polity without politics—is that we haven’t quite seen it up and running yet.

## similarity to another book

##
- the moral argument doesn't matter with the evidence, it's about stretching imaginations

## we don't have to look at the past
- [zw] but this seems to be KAA's point that he weirdly attributes to G&W, KAA quoting Rousseau: "Never mind the dawn, he was urging: we will not find our future in our past.", who [ZW para KAA] gave up the idea that his arguments had to have primordial examples of what he was proposing happen in the future




[^1]: ie was a "conservative backlash" against the progressive critique
[^2]: G&W quote is “our standard historical meta-narrative about the ambivalent progress of human civilization”; i think "ambivalent" here means: [zw] people felt two ways about it: it was good since we got cool stuff, but bad since we didn't get to live freely anymore
