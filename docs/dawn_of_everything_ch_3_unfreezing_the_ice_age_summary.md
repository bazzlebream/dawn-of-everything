# Dawn of Everything: Ch 3: Unfreezing the Ice Age (summary)

Mostly about political self-consciousness, and how it's been thought of and accessed.

- **culture**: complex symbolic human behavior^[p 83]
- **Upper Paleolithic period**: Archaeology. Roughly 50,000 to 15,000 BC, characterized by "princely" burials and grand communal buildings.
- **political (self-)consciousness**: The ability to argue and reflect about the proper way to live.^[p 93] Also see "visionary politics"
- **sapient paradox**: Tens of thousands of years stand between the biological origins of humanity and the widespread appearance of typically human forms of behavior; between when we became capable of creating culture and when we finally got round to doing it? What were we actually doing in the interim?

## 1. prehistory: humans started completely different and ended up the same

## 2. sapient paradox is mirage

## 3. political self-consciousness

### 3.1. actuarial intelligence
- [Christopher Boehm](boehm_christopher.md), an evolutionary anthropologist, came up with the term "[actuarial intelligence](actuarial_intelligence.md)" to describe the ability of humans to choose how they are going to act, including envisioning and choosing alternative social arrangements. He considered this the essence of humanity, being "self-conscious political actors".

### 3.2. Ice Age discoveries

### 3.3. primitive folk write-offs

### 3.4. losing seasonality

### 3.5. the penumbra

### 3.6. self-consciousness through seasonal variation

### 3.7. "losing" the seasonality in 1960s

### 3.8. "gaining" it back in festivals
