# Dawn of Everything: Ch 3: Unfreezing the Ice Age (summary)

## 1. terms

- **culture**: complex symbolic human behavior^[p 83]
- **Upper Paleolithic period**: Archaeology. Roughly 50,000 to 15,000 BC, characterized by "princely" burials and grand communal buildings.
- **political (self-)consciousness**: The ability to argue and reflect about the proper way to live.^[p 93] Also see "visionary politics"
- **sapient paradox**: Tens of thousands of years stand between the biological origins of humanity and the widespread appearance of typically human forms of behavior; between when we became capable of creating culture and when we finally got round to doing it? What were we actually doing in the interim?

## 2. mythbusting[^1]

### 2.1. why people make myths

- When you speculate without evidence, the speculation is likely to perpetuate myths. This would happen if they speculated about much of the last 3 million years, for which there is little archaeological evidence.

### 2.2. antimyth: humans started very very different and ended up basically the same

#### 2.2.1. some facts

- early human populations in Africa were extraordinarily diverse
- humans coexisted with other species, like *Homo naledi*; and then, in Eurasia, interbred with Neanderthals and Denisovans, among probably others
- humans lived in all of Africa, not just eastern savannas
- some populations were isolated for 100ks of years
- modern human elements came together quite late
- in this diversity, "behaviors like mating and child-rearing practices, the presence or absence of dominance hierarchies or forms of language and proto-language must have varied at least as much as physical types, and probably far more."
- down to 40,000 bc, the social and physical world of our ancestors would have seemed radically different

#### 2.2.2. myth: there is one original human society; or, humans started the same and ended up different.

##### 2.2.2.1. examples of the myth: mitochondrial eve (1980)

#### 2.2.3. catechism

- Myth: Someone mentions the Tower of Babel, or that all human mitochondria can be traced to a single person 120,000 years ago.
- Response: Yeah well sometime between 3mya and 200kya Africa basically looked like Middle Earth *including* diversity of societal organization.

- Myth: There is an original form of human society.
- Response: Uh no among other things the wide range of environments humans lived in almost guarantee extreme social diversity.

### 2.3. antimyth: human populations exhibit extremely early behavioral complexity

#### 2.3.1. some facts

#### 2.3.2. myth: the sapient paradox needs to be explained

#### 2.3.3. catechism

- Myth: A brain mutation 40,000 years ago accounts for the jump in cultural complexity at that time.
- Response: No, that jump in complexity is an illusion, largely due to most of the research being done at home, in Europe, by rich governments. Every year, new evidence accumulates for early behavioral complexity elsewhere. In fact, Europe's "culture" was probably even late to that party.

- Myth: Homo sapiens emerged when all the various elements of the modern human condition converged, definitively, in some stupendous moment of creation.
- Response: For sure no, and also what looks like a "sudden cultural efflorescence" is probably due to climate and demography. At the time you're thinking of, rich valleys were between inhospitable areas, so humans moved between enclosed environments which became densely packed (relatively) at certain times of year.

### 2.4. antimyth: (the sapient paradox returns)

- return of sapient paradox in new form:
	- insisting either
		- that for countless millennia we had modern brains, but for some reason decided to live like monkeys anyway;
		- or that we had the ability to overcome our simian instincts and organize ourselves in an endless variety of ways, but for some equally obscure reason only ever chose one way to organize ourselves.

### 2.5. antimyth: cool Ice Age discoveries are evidence of some ... stuff (belongs in catechism: but not "complex social hierarchy prior to farming")

#### 2.5.1. some facts

#### 2.5.2. myth: looks like humans have always had institutional inequality, even where we thought it was egalitarian

#### 2.5.3. catechism


## 3. actuarial intelligence


[^1]: The myth goes at the end here because whenever I read the myth first that's all I can remember.
