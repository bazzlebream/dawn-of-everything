# Western gaze

Indeed, a strong case can be made for the real origins of the ‘Western gaze’ – that rational, supposedly objective way of looking at strange and exotic cultures which came to characterize later European anthropology – lying not in travellers’ accounts, but rather in **European accounts of precisely these imaginary sceptical natives**: gazing inwards, brows furrowed, at the exotic curiosities of Europe itself.[^1]
