# egalitarian society

from [The dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md):

> “Usually, it’s defined negatively: as the absence of hierarchies (the belief that certain people or types of people are superior to others), or as the absence of relations of domination or exploitation. This is already quite complex, and the moment we try to define egalitarianism in positive terms everything becomes much more so.” p 125

- egalitarianism seems to refer to an ideal
	- **not just** that outsider would see all members of some group as interchangeable
	- **but rather** members of the group itself feel they ought to be the same (not in all ways, but in the ways that matter)
- egalitarianism implies that ideal is "largely, realized"

egalitarian society (approx def)
(1) most people in a given society feel they really ought to be the same in some specific way, or ways, that are agreed to be particularly important; and
(2) that ideal can be said to be largely achieved in practice.

- premise: all societies are organized around certain key values
- then: egalitarian societies are where almost everyone agrees that the paramount values should be, and are, *distributed equally*

- obvious problem
	- societies have radically different systems of value from one another
		- (what's important in one might have little to do with importance in other)
	- (ZW: not sure how this is directly connected)
		- imagine society where everyone "equal before gods" (no priests) but 50% are sharecroppers with no property
		- should we still call this "egalitarian", even if everyone, including sharecroppers, insists relation to gods is all that's important
