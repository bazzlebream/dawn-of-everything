# structures of exclusion
- the formal properties (underlying logic and social effects) are very similar between private property and the sacred
	- set apart
		- imperceptible connection with higher force or being
	- tabu ie "not to be touched"
- notion of private property
- notion of the sacred
- things confined to sacred contexts:
	- relations of command
	- humans impersonating spirits
	- absolute ("private") property
