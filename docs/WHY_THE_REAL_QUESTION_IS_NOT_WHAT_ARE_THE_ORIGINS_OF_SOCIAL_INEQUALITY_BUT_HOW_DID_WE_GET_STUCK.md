[^1]# why the real question is not ‘what are the origins of social inequality?’ but ‘how did we get stuck? (112-118)
ch 3, p 112-118

- assume: “human beings really have spent most of the last 40,000 or so years moving back and forth between different forms of social organization, building up hierarchies then dismantling them again”
- what are the implications?

look at [[pierre_clastres]]
- people in stateless societies were considerably more politically self-conscious
- they created "societies against the state" because they self-consciously organize to prevent domination
- and chiefs were calculating, but in an environment designed to ensure they couldn't exercise real power
	- winter groups tiny
	- summer, didn't lead at all
	- poorest men in village since basically providing welfare for everyone
	- set example by working hardest
	- privileges were double-edged (more wives = can't do anything about it if they adulterate)

critics of Clastres
- 1 used Rousseauian ground (these were primitive people, how could they have imagination)
- 2 how could you say they organized against something they never experienced?

objections to [2]
- (neighbors) empires are all around them
- (seasonality) they did experience arbitrary command, during yearly "adventures" as foraging bands

Clastres broke with: [[primitive societies are flexible]]
- so now even radicals thought they were stuck in a single, simple mode of social existence

(“So is Lowie’s conclusion that, since the chiefly office is effectively designed so it can never be turned into a means of compulsion, the only way state-like authority could possibly have emerged was from religious visionaries of one sort or another.”)

Clastres left out the seasonal police bit
- why? it's confusing; it's a wild card, and different everywhere

"Many Central African forager societies are egalitarian all year round, but appear to alternate monthly between a ritual order dominated by men and another dominated by women." (Knight 1991)
