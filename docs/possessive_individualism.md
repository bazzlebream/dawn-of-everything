# possessive individualism

- specific to weird European social thought
- - you "own" your body and legally can exclude others

> “Just as every man’s home is his castle, so your right not to be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned rests on the idea that you own your own body, just as you own your chattels and possessions, and legally have the right to exclude others from your land, or house, or car, and so on.”
