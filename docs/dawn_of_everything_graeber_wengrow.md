## 2. Wicked Liberty

*The indigenous critique and the myth of progress*

### 2.1. intro

### 2.2. IN WHICH WE SHOW HOW CRITIQUES OF EUROCENTRISM CAN BACKFIRE, AND END UP TURNING ABORIGINAL THINKERS INTO 'SOCK-PUPPETS'

[ • • •]

#### 2.2.1. section break

- "the problem of" "the origin of social inequality" was not a problem that would have made sense to people in the [[Middle Ages]]
	- ranks and hierarchies existed since "the very beginning"
	- even in Eden, Adam outranked Eve
- "social equality" and "social inequality" did not exist as concepts
	- [evidence]: recent survey of medieval literature finds no evidence of aequalitas or inaequalitas or cognates used to describe social relations before Columbus [^1]
- equality/inequality terms only "enter common currency" in early 17th century (1600s) after [[natural law theory]], which arose during debates about moral and legal implications of Europe's New World discoveries

### 2.3. “WHY EVEN VERY SOPHISTICATED RESEARCHERS STILL FIND WAYS TO CLING TO THE IDEA THAT SOCIAL INEQUALITY HAS AN ‘ORIGIN”

- points DoE is arguing against:
	- hunter-gatherers lived in a state of primordial innocence[^2]

terms

- **Upper Paleolithic period**: Archaeology. Roughly 50,000 to 15,000 BC, characterized by "princely" burials and grand communal buildings

history of ideas

- **Evolutionary Psychology**
	- "dominance behavior is hardwired in our genes, so much so that “the moment society goes beyond tiny bands, it must necessarily take the form of some ruling over others."[^3]

#### 2.3.1. analysis of Boehm

[[../boehm_christopher]]
- evolutionary anthropologist
- specialist in primare studies
- his arguments:[^4]
	- humans have instinct to engage in dom/sub behavior
		- this instinct is inherited from simian ancestors
		- (despite this instinct) humans are humans because they can choose to not act like that
		- itemizes tactics to humble any pretenders to dominance
			- these tactics don't have parallels with any primate (other than humans) behavior
			- his sources are ethnographic accounts of existing egalitarian foraging bands
				- eg. humans mock people for "chest-beating"
			- bullying is / may be instinctual, but "counter-bullying" is not
				- **[[../actuarial_intelligence]]**[^5]
					- similar to Aristotle's definition of humans as "political animals" - it's precisely what primates can't do[^6]

#### 2.3.2. considering the implications of Boehm

Boehm's point:

- essence of humanity is being self-conscious political actors
	- corollary: humans can embrace wide range of social arrangements
	- implication: humans explored a wide range of social arrangements over history[^7]

Boehm's conclusions:

- all humans until recently chose to follow same arrangements, that being "strictly egalitarian"
	- only with agriculture did humans follow hierarchy

## 3. Unfreezing the Ice Age

### 3.1. Unfreezing the Ice Age: intro
- [Unfreezing the Ice Age: intro](unfreezing_the_ice_age_intro.md)

### 3.2. “WHY THE ‘SAPIENT PARADOX’ IS A RED HERRING; AS SOON AS WE WERE HUMAN, WE STARTED DOING HUMAN THINGS”

i'm not sure if they're saying that there was no cultural efflorescence 45kya, or that there was, but for reasons of seasonal population density rather than anything else; there is no mismatch between genetic and cultural clocks, as it were, since no one lived that densely before??

**terms:**

- the [[sapient paradox]]: "why do so many tens of thousands of years stand between the biological origins of humanity[^8] and the widespread appearance of typically human forms of behaviour; between when we became capable of creating culture and when we finally got round to doing it? What were we actually doing in the interim?”
- homo sapiens "emerged": (more of a dig) “when all the various elements of the modern human condition converged, definitively, in some stupendous moment of creation.” (obviously DoE believe this was not a thing that happened)
- culture: “complex symbolic human behaviour” p 83

the sapient paradox is a mirage:

- archaeological evidence from europe is rich
	- european governments are generally rich
	- european professional institutions have been persuing prehistory longer "at home" then elsewhere
- in fact, with each year, new evidence accumulates for "early behavioral complexity elsewhere"
	- eg Panga ya Saidi cave site
		- Bornea and Sulawesi islands cave art
		- (future discoveries of comple pictorial art in africa)
- so:
	- Europe's "culture" late to the party
	- the "sudden cultural efflorescence" probably has to do with climate and demography
		- harsher and confined spaces
			- eg game-rich valleys (the space) bounded by tundra and dense coastal forests (the confiners)
		- ancesetors moved between enclosed environments
		- so, density of human interactions radically increased, especially at certain times of year

Boem states that humans ("political animals") lived egalitarian lives for 200,000 years, and then all of a sudden they began to live dominance/dominated lives[^9]

Due to this, Boehm insists that for tens of thousands of years (those 200,000 years) "nothing happened"[^10]

This conclusion is "unsettling," especially when we look at the evidence during that period of time[^11]

[^1]: DoE paraphrase of Boem
[^2]: DoE paraphrase of Boem; "nothing happened" is DoE quote, but presumably paraphrasing Boem
[^3]: DoE's point, and transition to next section
[^4]: DoE's paraphrase of evolutionary psychology theory, p 86
[^5]: DoE paraphrase of another's point
[^6]: according to Doe
[^7]: Boehm's term for the ability to "understand what their society might look like if they did things differently”, or "reflect consciously on different directions one's society could take, and make explicit arguments about the different paths"  according to DoE
[^8]: DoE point (I can't tell if taken from Boehm)
[^9]: DoE taking Boehm to logical conclusion
[^10]: my choice of phrase, just because they say "modern"; just means "before people knew about prehistory and dinosaurs" i guess
[^11]: DoE date the genetic basis for human uniformity to 500kya, with the caveat that it would not be possible to identify a more recent date when homo sapiens "emerged"
