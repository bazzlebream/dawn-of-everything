Boem states that humans ("political animals") lived egalitarian lives for 200,000 years, and then all of a sudden they began to live dominance/dominated lives[^1]

Due to this, Boehm insists that for tens of thousands of years (those 200,000 years) "nothing happened"[^2]

This conclusion is "unsettling," especially when we look at the evidence during that period of time[^3]

[^1]: DoE paraphrase of Boem
[^2]: DoE paraphrase of Boem; "nothing happened" is DoE quote, but presumably paraphrasing Boem
[^3]: DoE's point, and transition to next section
[^4]: DoE's paraphrase of evolutionary psychology theory, p 86
[^5]: DoE paraphrase of another's point
[^6]: according to Doe
[^7]: Boehm's term for the ability to "understand what their society might look like if they did things differently”, or "reflect consciously on different directions one's society could take, and make explicit arguments about the different paths"  according to DoE
[^8]: DoE point (I can't tell if taken from Boehm)
[^9]: DoE taking Boehm to logical conclusion
[^10]: my choice of phrase, just because they say "modern"; just means "before people knew about prehistory and dinosaurs" i guess
[^11]: DoE date the genetic basis for human uniformity to 500kya, with the caveat that it would not be possible to identify a more recent date when homo sapiens "emerged"
[^12]: Citation in the book is “Alfani, Guido and Roberta Frigeni. 2016. [Inequality (un)perceived](Inequality_un_perceived.md): the emergence of a discourse on economic inequality from the Middle Ages to the age of Revolution.’ Journal of European Economic History 45 (1): 21–66.”
