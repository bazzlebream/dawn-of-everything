# Wengrow response - Mesopotamia

> With regard to Mesopotamia, Appiah accuses us of drifting, in the space of a hundred pages, from a negative[^1] characterization of Uruk’s early phases—as lacking evidence for monarchy—to their positive[^2] characterization as examples of collective self-rule. He forgets the ground we cover in those pages, which review diligent work on the topic by Assyriologists, ancient historians, and archaeologists. What it shows is that, even in later periods of monarchy and empire, Mesopotamian cities exhibited a remarkable degree of self-governance through neighborhood assemblies, local wards, and councils. Where does Appiah think those forms of urban self-government came from? Would he have us believe the inhabitants of the earliest cities had no knowledge of them?


[ZW]: unstated, but presumably wengrow also deals with the [bifurcation fallacy](bifurcation%20fallacy.md) accusation by saying that they explore all sorts of other possibilities in those intervening 100 pages that Appiah skips over

[^1]: Wengrow here means "negative" in the logical sense (characterizing by the absence of something) rather than the evaluative sense (good or bad)
