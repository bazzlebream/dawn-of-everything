# a closed hermeneutic

But the settlements don’t show up in _The Cambridge Encyclopedia_ section on ancient cities. The definition of a city, as it’s come down to us, is “some kind of megalopolis with a big commercial, political, or administrative district in the middle.” And it has to be hierarchical, centralized, and everything Gordon Childe talked about generations ago when he defined the urban revolution.

There’s a closed hermeneutic about what a city is, which we try to break apart in the book. In particular, we argue against this constant shifting of the goalposts. When you have a society scaling up that doesn’t produce class stratification and rigid hierarchies, you can’t suddenly go blind.
