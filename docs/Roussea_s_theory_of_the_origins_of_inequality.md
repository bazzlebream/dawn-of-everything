# Roussea's theory of the origins of inequality

“But so is Rousseau’s argument that it was only the invention of agriculture that introduced genuine inequality, since it allowed for the emergence of landed property.”[^1]

## on a free society

> This is the problem with the Rousseauian tradition. He didn’t have a bloody clue what a free society would look like. His state of nature is a weird fantasy where we don’t even live in groups. We’re just individuals stomping through the forest blissfully happy, trying to avoid each other because interaction would mean we have to form social classes or something. It’s just weird.

> Rousseau might’ve agreed with Kondiaronk, had they ever met, about the virtues of freedom. But only Kondiaronk would’ve had any clue about what that actually looks like in practice.[^2]
