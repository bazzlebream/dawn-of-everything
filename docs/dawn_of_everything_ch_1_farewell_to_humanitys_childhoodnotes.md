# Dawn of Everything: Ch 1: Farewell to Humanity’s Childhood (notes)

> There are, certainly, tendencies in history. […] But the only ‘laws’ are those we make up ourselves.^[p 5]


## 1. why is the world shitty now, and why does it seem stuck that way?

#theme Main question: why the world seems to be in such a mess and why human beings so often treat each other badly – the reasons for war, greed, exploitation, systematic indifference to others’ suffering. ^[p 2]

### 1.1. models (answers)

#### 1.1.1. Christian answer

- people once lived in a state of innocence, but were tainted by original sin
- the sin was that people wanted to be godlike
- now we are punished for it
- now we live in a fallen state
- we hope for future redemption

#### 1.1.2. Rousseau

[Rousseau](jean-jaques_rousseau.md)'s version of the Christian story
- **source**: [Discourse on Inequality by Rousseau](discourse_on_inequality.md)
- **the model**
	- once we were hunter-gatherers
	- hunter-gatherers were in a state of childlike innocence, in tiny bands
	- the bands were egalitarian
	- they could be egalitarian because they were small
	- the [Agricultural Revolution](agricultural_revolution.md) occurs
	- "did not have experience enough to forsee the dangers "
	- cities arise
	- the happy condition ends
	- civilization and the state arise
	- with civilization and the state comes written literature, science and philosophy (good)
	- with civilization and the state comes patriarchy, standing armies, mass executions, annoying bureaucrats (bad)
- **you should know**
	- Rousseau by his own admission only intended this as a thought experiment, not a description of something that really happened^[p 11]
		- that is, it was never intended to be used as part of an evolutionary-stages model
		- it was intended as a parably attempt at a solution to a paradox: how does an innate drive for freedom lead humans to inequality?
- **implications**
	- generally favored by those on political spectrum "left"

#### 1.1.3. Hobbes

[Thomas Hobbes](thomas_hobbes.md)
- **source**: [Leviathan](leviathan.md)
- concerned with origins of the state
- **model**
	- humans are selfish (hierarchy, domination, self-interest are bassis of society)
	- humans lived in tiny bands
	- in the original [State of Nature](state_of_nature.md) life was not innocent, it was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short"
		- a state of war
			- (Hobbes did not mean this as a literal state of war)[^literalstateofwar]
		- only got along because of shared interest in survival of offspring
		- not founded on equality; an alpha-male leader
	- progress from this state is due entirely to repressive mechanisms Rousseau complained about:
		- governments, courts, bureaucracies, police
- **implications**
	- human society relies on the repression of baser instincts
		- even more necessary the larger and denser the living situation
		- we learned to prioritize long-term interests and create laws to confine our worst impulses to the economy
	- generally favored by those on political spectrum "right"

#### 1.1.4. Graeber and Wengrow

- before the advent of farming:
	- humans weren't just in small egalitarian bands
	- hunter-gatherers were bold social experimenters
- agriculture:
	- did not mean private property
	- did not mark inevitable step towards inequality
	- first farming communities free of ranks and hierarchies (relatively)
- cities:
	- many early cities were set on egalitarian lines
		- no need for authoritarian rules, warrior-politicians, bossy admins

```
Preparing for a conceptual shift:

- away from current notion of social evolution, characterized by:
	- human societies can be arranged according to states of development
	- each state has its own characteristic tech and forms of organization
- looking at the [indigenous critique](indigenous_critique.md) and the conservative backlash to it in the 18th century
```

#subchapter *why both the hobbesian and rousseauian versions of human history have dire political implications*^[p 6-9]

## 2. political implications of the models

### 2.1. Hobbes

[…]

### 2.2. Rousseau

- Rousseau model seems more optimistic than Hobbesian
- but it's used to convince us that technocratic reformism^["a bit of modest tinkering" p 6] is the best we can hope for, even if the system is unjust

### 2.3. the term "inequality"

- framing "the widening gulf between haves and have-nots" in terms of "inequality" reassures elites, since it implies no meaningful solution to the problem would be possible
	- the term is "practically designed to encourage half-measures"
	- what would it mean to eliminate inequality?
	- and what kind of inequality?
	- how equal would people have to be?
	- allows one to "tinker with the numbers"
	- doesn't address any of the factors people actually object to
		- #theme turning wealth into power over others
		- some are told their needs aren't important and their lives have no worth
	- makes "wistful pessimism" the norm
- how might it have been framed 100 years ago:
	- concentration of capital
	- oligopoly
	- class power

## 3. towards a more accurate model

- for 200,000 years, everyone on earth did not share the same idyllic form of social organization

### 3.1. objections and responses

O: Are you saying true equality has never been achieved? That it’s therefore impossible?

R:

1. It's bizarre to imagine that, even from 25,000 to 15,000 bc ([[Altamira wall paintings]]) no one anywhere experimented with different forms of social organization.
2. #theme The capacity to experiment is a quintessential part of what makes us human.
	1. #theme equal capacity to contribute to decisions about how to live together, and that that is a meaningful decision in the first place

We need to discover the freedoms that make us human in the first place.

- [Man makes himself](man_makes_himself_1936.md)
	- humans are products of collective self-creation

#subchapter *some brief examples of why received understandings of the broad sweep of human history are mostly wrong (or, the eternal return of jean-jacques rousseau)*^[p 9-11]

## 4. Trying to answer "questions about the origins of social inequality" is a bad place to start because you inevitably reproduce some variation on Rousseau's model.

### 4.1. Examples:

[[Francis Fukuyama]]: [The origins of political order: from prehuman times to the French revolution](origins_of_political_order_from_prehuman_times_to_the_french_revolution.md)
- the "default form of social organization" is (egalitarian) band-level society of chimpanzees
- Rousseau was correct to say that origin of inequality was in agriculture.
	- hunter-gatherers have no concept of private property
	- no incentive to mark out piece of land as their own

[[Jared Diamond]] [[The world until yesterday: what can we learn from traditional societies (2012)]]
- such hunter-gatherer bands were only a few dozen people, biologically related
- led a meager existence
- simple social lives
- face-to-face discussion, few personal possessions, no formal political leadership
- social equality can only be achieved in circumstances like this

For Diamond, Fukuyama, and Rousseau, agriculture, and the higher populations, ended that equality.[^sharedmodel]

- bands to tribes
- food surplus to population growth
- tribes to ranked chiefdoms
- wars over resources
- hierarchies emerge (inevitable in large complex forms of organization) (Diamond and Fukuyama)
	- (these do not start as not permanent statuses)
- no going back
- chiefs get everyone to call the king and emperor

#subchapter *on the pursuit of happiness*^[p 11-20]

As we saw above, though, neither Rousseau nor Hobbes intended their models to lay the groundwork for an evolutionary history; they intended them as thought experiments or allegories.

- [[steven_pinker]] as modern Hobbesian[^Hobbesian] with [The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined (2012)](the_better_angels_of_our_nature_why_violence_has_declined_2012_.md)
	- thesis: our world is far less violence and cruel than that of our ancestors
		- logical outcome of sovereign states with a monopoly of legitimate use of violence inside borders
	- concerned with origins of the state, like Hobbes
		- key point of transition is emergence of cities

[^Hobbesian]: aka a "State of Nature theorist"

Pinker chooses "Ötzi the Tyrolean Iceman" to prove that "ancients" were always killing each other.

G&W reach the exact opposite conclusion:
- hey, we can cherry-pick too!
- if we did examine [Paleolithic](Paleolithic.md) burials, we'd probably conclude that humans are nurturing and care-giving
- [Paleolithic](Paleolithic.md) hunter-gatherer burials show high-frequences of health-related disabilities, but also high-levels of care until, and beyond, death
	-  [Romito 2](romito_2.md) is a good example
-  however, that's not what we want to explore
	-  (beside the fact that "only rather unusual individuals" seem to have been buried at all during that time period)

Rousseauean tradition, when cherry-picking, pick
- [Hadza](east_african_hadza.md)
- [Pygmies](Pygmy)
- [!Kung](san_bushmen.md)
Hobbesians choose 
- [Yanomami](yanomami.md)
	- (in particular [Pinker](steven_pinker.md), for whom they represent the [Hobbesian trap](hobbesian_trap.md))

Problems with the Hobbesian trap argument (qv)

Pinker positions self as rational centrist, insisting  that all good things come only from Europe, which ensures his work can be read as a retroactive apology for genocide, etc.

One way to tell if this is how people actually feel (prioritizing one kind of society over another) is through  [contests of civilization](contests_of_civilization.md). Historical and ethnographic examples illustrate that people almost always choose the non-European lifestyle, and can offer clear reasons for decisions to return to, or stay with, non-European communities:
- virtues of freedom
	- sexual
	- from expectation of constant toil to get land and wealth
- no one was "allowed" to be poor, hungry, or destitute
	- life was better when no one was in abject misery
- actual "equality of opportunity" (achieving acceptance and prominent positions in adoptive communities) rather than Western lipservice to it
- intensity of social bonds: mutual care, love, happiness

#subchapter *how the conventional narrative of human history is not only wrong, but quite needlessly dull*^[pp 21-24]

[Yes, you have to simplify the world to say something new about it](theory_that_you_have_to_simplify_the_world_to_say_something_new_about_it.md)

Hobbes and Rousseau were doing that at the time, but now their ideas are old, and do not justify continued simplification. Continued simplification "impoverishes our sense of human possibility."

People point to objects moving around 10kya as evidence of "primitive trade" and therefore show that "contemporary forms of compettiive market exchange" are "rooted in human nature." However, there are a ton of different, well-documented, processess and reasons for objects moving a lot over great distances. In fact, the phenomenon is known under the phrase [long-distance interaction spheres](long-distance_interaction_spheres.md). The fact that writers can't imagine any of these actually documented alternatives shows again that evidence is way more interesting and diverse than their thought experiments.^[Please see the [interaction spheres page](long-distance_interaction_spheres.md), as well as specifics on [Argonauts of the Western Pacific](argonauts_of_the_western_pacific.md) for more detailed information which appears in this section.]

#theme 
- Not a new history of humankind.
- A new science of history. (Restore ancestors to full humanity.)
	- lay down the foundations for a new world history 
		- like [V. Gordon Childe](v_gordon_child.md) in 1930s with his "Revolution" terms
		- so, it will be uneven
	- quest to discover right questions
		- what is the biggest question we should be asking
			- something has been lost
				- Rousseau's notion wasn't right
				- but how should we characterize it?
				- and how lost is it?
- How did inequality become an issue at all? (Not: "how did we end up unequal?")
- What were humans doing that whole 200,000 years if they weren't in tiny egalitarian bands.
- What did agriculture and cities imply, if not hierarchy and domination.
- What was really happening when we've tended to see the emergence of the state.




#approach 
> It would be just as easy (actually, rather easier) to identify things that can be interpreted as the first stirrings of rationalism, legality, deliberative democracy and so forth all over the world, and only then tell the story of how they coalesced into the current global system.^[p 17]

[^literalstateofwar]: Hobbes was doing much the same thing when he wrote in Leviathan that the primordial state of human society would necessarily have been a ‘Bellum omnium contra omnes’, a war of all against all, which could only be overcome by the creation of an absolute sovereign power. He wasn’t saying there had actually been a time when everyone lived in such a primordial state. Some suspect that Hobbes’s state of war was really an allegory for his native England’s descent into civil war in the mid seventeenth century, which drove the royalist author into exile in Paris. Whatever the case, the closest Hobbes himself came to suggesting this state really existed was when he noted how the only people who weren’t under the ultimate authority of some king were the kings themselves, and they always seemed to be at war with one another. (p 12)
[^sharedmodel]: What follows below is an amalgam of all three models, presumably.
