# Wrong About (Almost) Everything

[source](https://www.focaalblog.com/2021/12/22/chris-knight-wrong-about-almost-everything/)

[Wrong About (Almost) Everything](wrong_about_almost_everything_chris_knight.md) is a review article on  [The dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md), published 2021-12-22

- he sees these two points in conflict
	- humans are so politically experimental that they will intentionally choose a social structure characterized by oppression, after having acted in one characterized by egalitarianism, merely for the sake of change[^1]
		- corollary: history is this oscillatory between extremes (people reproducing social structures characterized by egalitarianism, or oppression)
		- we are stuck in the "oppression" one
			- why did we get stuck in that oppression one
	- political instincts and social emptions that define our humanity wre shaped under conditions of egalitarianism

[his revolution theory](his_revolution_theory.md)

## 1. point by point

### 1.1. point one
Once an egalitarian social structure was produced, even though humans are experimental, their very self-awareness[^3] of the alternative would have prevailed over the experimentalism,[^4] and we wouldn't see any dominance structures arise

> G&W oppose the whole idea that our hunter-gatherer ancestors were egalitarians. In their view, they would just as likely have chosen to be oppressed.[^2]

CK arrives at this view in part by interpreting [“WHY EVEN VERY SOPHISTICATED RESEARCHERS STILL FIND WAYS TO CLING TO THE IDEA THAT SOCIAL INEQUALITY HAS AN ‘ORIGIN”](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md#“WHY_EVEN_VERY_SOPHISTICATED_RESEARCHERS_STILL_FIND_WAYS_TO_CLING_TO_THE_IDEA_THAT_SOCIAL_INEQUALITY_HAS_AN_‘ORIGIN”)

DoE essentially attempt to discredit[^5] Boehm's revolution theory (an "abstract" version of Knight's own [Blood Relations. Menstruation and the origins of culture](Blood_Relations._Menstruation_and_the_origins_of_culture.md))

CK's paraphrase of [boehm_christopher](boehm_christopher.md)'s points in Boehm's [Hierarchy in the forest. The evolution of egalitarian behavior](Hierarchy_in_the_forest._The_evolution_of_egalitarian_behavior.md)

- earliest ancestors weren't completely[^6] cooperative or competitive
	- what they *were* was disposed to dominate some ("others") while allying with some ("not others") to resist being dominated
	- the resistance "from below"[^7] (presumably the domination-resistance) lead to everyone "coming together" to prevent a leader from dominating everyone
	- this is "**reverse dominance**": rule by a morally aware community commited to an egalitarian ethos

CK thinks he and DoE are aligned in thinking humans innately don't want to be dominated, and have access to (largely interpersonal-emotional) tactics to resist domination, that primates don't have

**However, CK takes issue that DoE doesn't explore the idea that these interpersonal-emotional tactics (IET) shaped human nature during the evolution of homo sapiens**
***i don't think CK ever develops this point***

### 1.2. point two?
DoE get Boehm wrong
Ck paraphrases:
- DoE think Boehm is saying that nothing political happened in the 200,000 years between egalitarianism being everywhere, and then 12,000 years go dominance being (mostly) everywhere
- Boehm actually posited a [diffusionist](diffusionism.md) model, whereby:
	- early humans developed numerous political systems (so, (self-conscious?) experimentation)
	-  a single band "invented" an egalitarian order
	- this egalitarian order was visibly advantageous to those being dominated
	- a "gradual cultural diffusion" took place, (implied because) the egalitarian traditions were attractice
	- long distance migration patterns spread the invention to the whole world
- CK? "this is how successful revolutions work"
		
so far:
- CK agrees with CB (and DoE) that early humans were at least experimenting with different social forms 200,000 years ago
- CK disagrees with DoE when DoE says that the ~200k year period would have seen anything except egalitarian social orders (ie lots of different social structures), because (CK believes) once it was invented in a single place and then spread to the world it was there to stay, until 12k years ago

### 1.3. the teatime of everything
- CK: DoE claims that Darwinism is pure myth
	- ZW: I can't find this claim, other than a footnote • [^10] The point of the footnote seems to be that Darwinism did not establish the "timescale" of human prehistory, not that Darwinism as a theory is a myth[^11]
- CK: Whatever they may have to say about [social evolutionism](social_evolutionism.md), it should not automatically apply to [[modern evolutionary theory]]
- CK: any theory of human origins should (at least) acknowledge evolutionary theory
	- (ZW: CK's unstated premise?: DoE is trying to articulate, or at least use, a theory of human origins, in what they are doing)
	- CK: DoE does not acknowledge evolutionary theory
	- CK: therefore we should not seriously consider their theory
- (ZW: CK's unstated transition: a theory of human origins should be based on scientific knowledge, and since they don't use the sciences of modern evolutionary theory or darwinism, what science do they use?)
	- CK: they use "archaeological science"
		- CK: they only even use archaeological science findings from within the last 30kya
		- CK: this (30kya) is where DoE dates the Dawn of Everything as a date
			- CK: their argument in dating it this way is that nothing about human social life can be gleaned from before this date due to scant evidence
- (ZW: I don't know how to parse this: This excuse no longer works in the light of recent evidence that our species’ most unique trait – art and symbolic culture – emerged in Africa three or four times earlier than was previously thought. By no means limited to bones and stones, this evidence consists of beads, geometric engravings, burials with grave goods and artefacts such as grindstones and paint pots, all invariably found in association with red ochre (Henshilwood _et al_. 2009, 2011). G&W do notice one or two of these discoveries (pp. 83-4) but show little interest – despite the fact that when cutting-edge Darwinian theory is applied to the ochre record, the possibilities for generating predictions about social dynamics, patterns of ritual performance and gendered alliances become very real (Power 2009, 2019; Power et al. 2013; Power et al. 2021; Watts 2014).)
- CK: they don't "go near" Darwinism
	- they even belittle (or minimize or compartmentalize) the findings of [[Hrdy's theory about the role of childcare in shaping human psychology]]
		- first they call it just a story or myth
		- then they say it's important
		- then they say insights like it can only be partial due to an absence of Eve
		- CK: this is a trick
			- Hrdy's work is focused on emergence of *Homo* genus 2my before dating of common mitochondrial ancestor[^12]
			- they ignore Hrdy's work in this area, so imply there's no value in pursuing "human origins research"[^13]
				- ZW: I don't think this is what they imply; at most they imply that any speculation about what human life was like before 42kya has nothing in the historical or ethnographic record (of the estimated amount of wild diversity) with which to use to speculate, and therefore will always be partial
					- sort of like, if you're trying to find "the" "original" form of human society, and you agree that it was more than 42kya, then that's evidentiarily impossible, because before 42kya there was nothing that resembled a single human society even in the way that there afterwards could be said to be

Ck says:
- Doe conflates modern evolutionary theory with [[social evolutionism]]
- DoE says that Darwinism (as applied by modern evolutionary theory) is not scientific and is not true
- DoE only recognizes "archaeological science", and then only back to 30k years ago
	- they restrict the period b/c they say nothing about politics or social life can be known from the little physical evidence before then

CK argues:
- premise: human's most unique trait is art and symbolic culture
- there is evidence that art and symbolic culture emerged in Africa "3 or 4 times earlier than previously thought"
	- evidence is bones, stones, beads, engravings, burials with grave goods, grindstones, paint pots
	- all this evidence is associated with [[red ochre]]
- "when cutting-edge Darwinian theory is applied to the ochre record, the possibilities for *generating predictions* about social dynamics, patterns of ritual performance and gendered alliances become very real ([[Power 2009, 2019; Power et al. 2013; Power et al. 2021]]; [[Watts 2014]])."[^8]

CK concessions
- DoE does recognize a few of these discoveries, but are not interested
- Readers interested in Mesolithic and Neolithic archaeology will find plenty of intriguing speculations in this book.

CK goes on:
- instead of engaging with Darwinism, DoE instad bring up [[Sarah Hrdy]]'s [theory](Mothers_and_others.md)  about how childcare shaped human instincts and psychology
- they critique Hrd's theory by saying it's partial
- their fallacy: they ignore the fact that Hrdy's work is focused on emergence of Homo genus 2 million years before common mitochondrial DNA ancestor
- their goal: undermine the idea that human origins[^9] research is worth pursuing at all
- if you are interested in how we became human – how we developed our unusually revealing eyes, our extraordinarily large brains, our distinctively social emotions, our laughter, our innate capacity for music and language – you won’t find anything at all!

#### 1.3.1. point: The title is seriously misleading.
- The title should be *Teatime*
	- why?
		- begins with [[european_upper_paleolithic]]
		- oh i see, because it's not dawn as a time of day

the section CK cites here, [intro](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md#intro)

transition: archaeology gets interesting here, to DoE
- emergence of surplus
- emergence of elites
- evidence for social complexity, hierarchy, burials

[^10]: Note #2 on p 79: “2. The phrase we owe to Thomas Trautmann’s (1992) account of this ‘time revolution’. While the field of anthropology came into existence during the ‘decade of Darwin’ (i.e. between the publication of The Origin of Species in 1859 and The Descent of Man in 1871), it was not actually Darwinism but archaeological excavations that established the timescale of human prehistory as we know it. Geology paved the way, replacing the biblically inspired view of earth’s genesis as a series of rapid titanic upheavals with a more mechanistic and gradual account of our planet’s origins. More detailed studies of the early development of scientific prehistory, and how fossil evidence and stone tools were first fitted into this expanded chronology of life on earth, can be found in Schnapp 1993 and Trigger 2006.” [The dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md) p 538 (notes)
[^11]: in the sense of myth used in this chapter in DoE
[^12]: DoE call this "mitochondrial Eve" and that DNA sequencing mitochondria demonstrated that such a organism must have existed perhaps only 120kya
[^13]: "human origins research": CK defines this in the next paragraph, I believe:  if you are interested in how we became human – how we developed our unusually revealing eyes, our extraordinarily large brains, our distinctively social emotions, our laughter, our innate capacity for music and language – you won’t find anything at all!
