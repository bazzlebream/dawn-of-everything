# Dawn of Everything: Ch 10: Why the State Has No Origin (notes)

## ∆ Main themes of chapter

- We are not talking about "the birth of the state".
- Rather, "We are speaking instead of broad regional systems; it just happens, in the case of Egypt and the Andes, that an entire regional system became united (at least some of the time) under a single government"[^1]
- The three elementary forms of (social) domination:
	- control of violence (sovereignty)
	- control of knowledge (administration)
	- charismatic power (heroic politics)
- The elementary forms can "crystallize" into an "institutional" form, shown above in parenthesis next to the respective elemental form.
- The notion of first, second, and third "orders" of regimes, according to how many of the institutions of domination "reinforce each other as the basis of government"[^2]

- In what form did 'bureaucracy' (institutional control of knowledge) emerge?[^3]
	- NOT as a practical solution to information management problems
- The principle of cultural uniformity.[^4]
	- also mentioned in previous chapter
	- uniformity can be good or bad
- money and administration are based on principles of "impersonal" equivalence
	- money : promises :: state bureaucracy : principle of care
	- (that is, fundamental "building blocks of social life corrupted by math and violence")
- the term "the state" redefined to mean the totalitarian impulse that lies behind all such claims (…), the desire effectively to make the ritual last forever.[^5]
- really, "civilization" and "state" aren't a package deal; they come as a historically unique combination of elements of different origins, which can drift apart.
- on female political rule in Minoan Crete
- all human societies paint on walls, basically.

## § (intro) [359 - 362 )

### ¶ (all)

- origins of the term "the state"
	- coined by [Jean Bodin](bodin_jean.md) in the late 16th century
	- attempt at systematic definition made by [[Rudolf von Ihering]] in late 19th century
		- a state is "[[any institution that claims a monopoly on the legitimate use of coercive force within a given territory]]"
		- works fairly well for modern states
		- for most of history, though
			- rulers didn't make such big claims
			- if they did, it was considered as if they'd said they could control the weather
	- (so to retain the definition, you'd have to say either:)
		- Hammurabi's Babylon, eg, wasn't a state at all; or
		- come up with better definition
	- so, Marxist definition: states make their first appearance in history to protect the power of an emerging ruling class • an apparatus of rule is created when one group routinely lives off another group's labor (exploits them) • this apparatus will be to protect their property rights, but in reality to preserve their advantage
		- (DG identifies this with Rousseau tradition)
		- brings Babylon, eg, back in; but
		- new conceptual problems: how to define exploitation
		- liberals didn't like it, since it implied the state could never be benevolent

[ • • •]

#### Aztec empire ( - 373)

#### Inca empire (373-375)

- [[Sapa Inca]]
- pharaoh-like system of expansion
- delegating royal authority
- sovereign's presence required
- road systems, shrines, way stations
- sexual violence and the class system in place leasd to subjects as "conquered women"

##### khipu: famous Inca administrative system (375)

- khipu / quipu knotted strings keep records
	- khipukamayuqs (knot-keepers or knot-orderers)
	- kept in use until recent times in remote Andean communities
	- most elaborate actually encoded topography, genealogy, narratives, and songs

#### powerful kingdoms ideal targets for conquest (375-)

- easily identifiable capitals
- easily identifiable kings (could be killed or captured)
- people accustomed to obeying orders, or (in rejection) join the conquerors

#aside Empires based on military rule are easily seized if you capture the center of power; after that, you take over the mechanisms of rule easily.

#### decentralized polities harder to conquer

```
- We can trace a "spirit of rebellion" (associated with these decentralized politics) all the way back to the 8th century ad.
- At first it seems like it only goes back to 1546 rebellion against the Spanish, and up to present day.
- Then we see it extends back to the end of the Classic Maya period, around 900 ad.
```

##### Maya language area

- geographic area: Yucatan, Guatemala and Chiapas highlands to the south
- example of attempted conquest
	- initial spanish incursions
	- area looked like "endless succession of tiny principalities", some seasonal
	- Spanish think they complete the conquering, and then face myriad popular revolts

###### Caste War

- what became the "[[Caste War]]" could be said to have started in 1546 with a rebellion against the Spanish
	- still rebels holding out during [[Mexican Revolution]]
	- could argue it continues with the [[Zapatista]] movement in [[Chiapas]]
- so, no major state or empire in certain large areas for centuries
	- "women come to the fore in anti-colonial struggles" as organizers of resistance and defenders of indigenous traditions

#### Classic Maya period (ad 150-900) (p 377)

- we don't know if there were prophetic movements or periodic insurrections; all we have is information about the rulers
- but we do know:
	- in last centuries of that period, women newly visible in sculpture and inscription as powerful rulers and spirit mediums
	- in the 9th century, the Classic Maya political system came apart, and the great cities were abandoned, largely

##### theories about the coming-apart

- popular resistance "played a part" (we don't know how much of a part)
- (  )
	- where people did stay in a city, kingship changed character to be more ceremonial, and day-to-day governance went into hands of collective coalition of warriors and priests
	- construction or use of "assembly halls" for local representative (originally thought to be royal palaces)

#### time the Spanish arrive (1500s)

- Mayan societies "thoroughly decentralized", many without kings
- "overbearing rulers" regularly disposed of
	- [[Chilam Balam]]
		- "disasters and miseries that befall oppressive rulers"
- *so we can actually trace this "spirit of rebellion" to the 8th century ad (instead of just back to the rebellions against the Spanish in mid-1500s)*[^6]

#### comparison of Classic Maya and Post-Classi (900-1520)

- art
	- Classic Maya is one of the best art tradition in the world
		- patronage of fine arts by a warlord who sacrifices humans
	- Post-Classic seem "clumsy and less worthy of appreciation"
		- not being ritually murdered and having decentralized local government

**transition to next section's themes:**
#aside People look at the products of a Post-Classic-like period and overlook it, which leads to habits of thought that ignore "periods of relative freedom and equality"

## § in which we offer a digression on ‘the shape of time’, and specifically how metaphors of growth and decay introduce unnoticed political biases into our view of history (379-383)

### ∆

There have been no identified systematic relations or patterns between events that cultures experience (established by Alfred Kroeber's *Configurations of Cultural Growth (1944)*). However, academics often act as though such patterns did exist, and divide up time and space label the resulting those divisions. These names become canonical. (Examples include things like "post" and "proto", and Egyptian terms like "Old", "Middle", and "New" Kingdoms.) More specifically, and started by German models, the "pattern" consists of supposed alternations between "unity" and "disintegration", and only the "unity" periods are thought to constitute the real, interesting history.

(extending to next §s)

An alternate approach involves concentrating on these interstitial (apparently boring and unstable) periods. Doing so reveals examples of "First Order regimes". In a First Order regime, the society stresses to an exceptional degree, and develops on a large scale,  one particular form of the elementary principles of domination. charismatic politics (Olmec) and knowledge-control (Chavín) and sovereignty (Natchez and also the [[Shilluk]])

A few things become evident from these examples:

- None of these would be labeled "states".
- None of them are "egalitarian".
- All are organized around an elite class.
- It is unclear how much the existence of the elite class actually restricted freedoms.
- None of them could "mobilize labor" reliably, if at all.

In order to understand how any of these First Order regimes might becomes states, the cases of Egypt and Anyang are instructive. In Anyang, victims at royal burials are war captives. In Egypt, they are either royal family or close retainers and carers. Since Egypt and Anyang are cases of "sovereignty" as the organizing principle, it looks like sovereignty gains power by "turning violence into kinship" (killing people makes them part of the royal house) and "turning the process of producing kinship" into the process of producing kingship (they are turned into members of the royal house, and this violence itself produces the king-y-ness of the rulers).

By examining Egypt, a method for state formation becomes clear. A focus on "sovereignty", maybe confined to rituals, leads to murder on the death of a ruler. Having to provide for the dead ruler (through mortuary cults, etc) allows for the reorganization of all social life around that goal. More specifics regarding this process become clear, including:

- creation of classes by indebting certain families to others to fulfill their mortuary obligations (the various offerings now being a ritual necessity)
- creation of the world's first peasantry
- creation of "social machines"  (that is, roughly, production lines where people are the machines) based on the organization of maritime activities
- celebrations afterwards
- nascent "knowledge-control" elements by requiring the factory workers to undergo age-grade rituals

[408]

### § intro [379-380)

- why terms like : post, proto, intermediate, terminal
	- products of [[early-twentieth-century cultural theory]]
	- [[Alfred Kroeber]], anthropologist, wanted to look for laws behind cultural growth and decay; ie if you could establish systematic relations between different large-scale events or periods
		- he concluded: no, there weren't
		- [[Configurations of Cultural Growth]] (1944)

```
- Yet, in writing about the past, we act as though patterns did exist.
- The "real" history is seen as being when there is strong government.
- We have a new approach, and that is to examine the "intermediary" periods.
```

- typical metaphors:
	- flowers
	- grand building (used indiscriminately )

### examining "intermediary" periods (380)

#### case histories

##### Thebes (754-525 bc)

- the "god's wife of Amun" (x5) period, of rule by women, hardly discussed because it spans the "Third Intermediate" (and "Late") periods

##### terminology is recent

- (just like the terms post, proto, intermediate, terminal), which were products of early twentieth century cultural theory …
- tripartite division of Egypt's history into Old, Middle, and New kingdoms was proposed by Egyptologists in the late 19th century, explicitly modeled on European nation states
	- German tendency to impose "cyclical alternations between unity and disintegration"
	- schemes reflect the author's political concerns

#aside (?) **how did they become canonical**

###### Middle Kingdom (2055-1650 bc) 4kya

- after [[First Intermediate Period]]

What is true of time, incidentally, is also true of space. [^7]

**amphictyony, n.**  *Ancient Greek History.*  Any of several alliances of neighbouring ancient Greek tribes or states formed to protect common interests. Also in extended use: a league, an alliance; a clique.

most of space and time in the last 5,000 years is characterized by areas of people who systematically avoided fixed, overarching systems of authority

let's do an approach that looks at things through this lens and see how well it explains anomalous cases

##### Olmec (383)

(see next section)

## § on politics as sport: the Olmec case (383-)

- the Olmec are anomalous enough that's it's been difficult for archaeologists to describe them
- easily identifiable style suddenly "popped up" between 1500-1000 bc across an enormous area
- seemed to be the "mother culture" of later Mesoamerican civilizations
	- calendar systems
	- glyphic writing
	- ball games
- yet no reason to assume unified ethnically or politically
- heartland in marshlands of Veracruz
- internal structure of cities poorly understood
	- centered on ceremonial precincts
		- large earthen pyramid mounds
	- surrounded by extensive suburbs
		- small maize-farming settlements and seasonal forager camps
		- for an early summary see Pool, Christopher A. 2007. Olmec Archaeology and Early Mesoamerica. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

### what can we say about Olmec society structure

- not egalitarian
- marked elites
- pyramids and monuments suggest elites had skill and labor at disposal
- otherwise, ties between center and hinterland were superficial
- also: "absolutely colossal sculpted heads"
	- basalt
	- fine quality
	- so much grinding to make
	- represent Olmec leaders, but wearing leather ball helmets
	- standard of male beauty, while also unique portraits
- (joining elites and helmets)
	- though can't find ball courts
	- can conclude a fairly direct relationship between competitive games and rise of Olmec aristocracy
- look at ball games to see how it worked

#### ball games

note: we're looking at *later Mesoamerican ball games* because we don't know what the Olmec games were actually like

- stone ball-courts common Classic Maya features
	- also royal residences, pyramid-temples

The ball sport was definitely central to charisma and authority notions:

- *"fusion of political competition and organized spectacle"* (386)
- chief Maya gods were ball players
- greatest known Maya epic about ball game
	- [[Popol Vuh]]: mortals and gods compete, birth of Hero Twins, then beat gods
- inscribed staircase marking accession of [[Bird Jaguar the Great]], in which prepares to strike huge rubber ball with unfortunate person inside (maybe [Jewelled Skull](Jewelled%20Skull))
	- (captured high-ranking enemies often killed at ball games if their ransom wasn't paid: this was major objective of war)
- competitive sports were substitute for war (one was extension of the other)
	- annual cycle of royal competitions for life and death (battles and games)
		- recorded on monuments
- mass spectacles, "cultivating a particular sort of urban public"
	- the one that likes gladiator combat
	- understands politics in terms of opposition
	- you might gamble yourself into slavery

- so, Olmec seen as cultural progenitors of later MesoAmerica
- however, little evidence that the Olmec created an "infrastructure for dominating a large population"
	- no stable military commanded by rulers
	- no admin apparatus to extend power
- rather, presided over spread of cultural influence (out from ceremonial centers)
	- and perhaps these centers only densely occupied seasonally or at certain times, probably in concert with agriculture too

## §chavín de huántar – an ‘empire’ built on images? (385-)

- [[ Chavín de Huántar]] - in South America
- area later controlled by [[Inca]]
- no writing, but from 600 ad used knotting strings for records and other notation

- monumental centers appearing in [Rio Supe](Rio_Supe.md) in 2999-2000 bc (3rd millennium)
- later (1000 to 200 bc), a single center at [Chavín de Huántar](chavin_de_huantar.md) extended influence over large area
- called the [[Chavín horizon]]
	- turned into three distinct regional cultures
	- [[Wari]] (militarized polity, central highlands)
	- [[Tiwanaku]] (metropolis, Lake Titicaca, 420 hectares, system of raised fields to grow crops on [[altiplano]])
	- [[Moche]] (female leadership, north coast of Peru, lavish tombs of warrior-priestesses and queens with gold and human sacrifices)[^8]

- Europeans (late 1800s, early 1900s) assumed these centers were capitals of empires, and that the rulers were male
	- thought [Chavín de Huántar](chavin_de_huantar.md) was core of pre-Inca empire in 1st millenium bc
		- seemed to match sophistication and size of cut-stone architecture, sculpture, and motifs appearing all over a huge territory
- they were wrong
- specific point: the "influence" these centers were supposed to wield was in the form of images distributed on small ceramic vessels, personal adornment, and textiles (rather than techs of admin, military, or commerce institutions)

- let's look at these **images** to see what Chavin de Huantar actually was
	- importance of "vision" and "knowledge" in Chavin notions of power

### art of images

- sure we're not dealing with empire:
	- empires "favor styles of figural art that are large and simple"
	- Chavin images are the opposite:
		- not pictures
		- not pictorial narratives
		- not pictographic writing system
		- complex, difficult to place images that seem to morph[^9]
		- monsters, but not like Greek composites (centaurs)
			- shape-shifters
			- mental training required to find structure from "visual mayhem"
	- how are we confident about this description?
		- Amerindian tradition where images are visual cures for memory (rather than illustrations or representations) [[Chimera Principle]]
		- with Chavin, we know they're shamanic journeys
			- the weirdness of images
			- circumstantial evidence about altered consciousness
				- snuff spoons
				- mortars
				- bone pipes
				- sculpted male figures with fangs and snake headdresses holding up cacti ([[Huachuma]])
				- vilca leaves

#### image art related to esoteric knowledge

(back to monuments)
- nothing related to secular government at all
	- no military forts
	- no admin quarters
- almost everything has to do with ritual and revelation/concealment of esoteric knowledge[^10]
	> For as long as anyone could remember, they said, Chavín had been a place of pilgrimage but also one of supernatural danger, on which the heads of important families converged from 	different parts of the country to seek visions and oracles: the ‘speech of the stones’.[^11]
- wacky architecture
	- temples contain stone labyrinths, hanging staircases for trials, initiations, and vision quests
	- tiny sanctum with monolith, complex image carvings
	- [[El Lanzon]]
		- god, axis mundi, pillar connecting polar ends of shamanic universe

### ¶ section break (390-)

```
Introduction of a new term: "First order regimes". These are polities which are organized around only one of the 3epsd, to the relative negleect of the other two.
- Chavín: knowledge-control
- Olmec: charismatic politics
- Natchez: sovereignty

```

3EPSD

### first order regimes: looking at cases through 3 elementary principles of (social) domination

- organized around only one of 3epsd
- relative neglect of other two

- using "empire" very loosely
	- Chavin built on images linked to esoteric knowledge
	- Olmec built on spectacle, competition, attributes of political leaders
- don't fulfill sociological criteria for statehood
	- **no monopoly of violence**
	- **no levels of admin hierarchy**

what's also related to 3epsd is "each stressed particular form of domination *to an exceptional degree* and *develops it on an unusually large scale*"

#### Chavín: knowledge-control

- power over large, dispersed population
	- was about "retaining control over knowledge"
		- logically similar to "state secrets", but content completely different, and **no military force to back it up**
- no doubt *some* personal charisma / jockeying

#### Olmec: charismatic politics

- power was formalized ways of competing for personal recognition
	- "play laced with risk"
	- large-scale competitive political field
	- importantly **without territorial sovereignty or admin apparatus**
- no doubt *some* influence from arcane knowledge

in neither was anyone "asserting strong principle of sovereignty"

#### ?? what we're looking for: sovereignty

- ie "certain people granted monopoly on right to use violence with impunity"
- also must: take it to extreme lengths
- and very little "apparatus for controlling knowledge" or "any soft of competitive political field"
- there are **a lot** of examples

#### Natchez: sovereignty (and later: Shilluk)

- [[Natchez]] aka Théoloël "People of the Sun"
- divine kingship
- ruler had absolute power of command
- no or minimal bureaucracy
- no competitive political field
- never referred to as "state" as far as G&W know

## § on sovereignty without "the state"

### ¶ (intro) [392-)

#### Natchez

[ • • •]

#### internal dynamics of sovereignty

- #foreshadow establishing connection to nurture/violence thing
	> Those sacrificed on such occasions consisted largely of people who were, up to that point, immediately responsible for the king’s care and his physical needs – including his wives, who were invariably commoners

- **cosmological principle of divine kings / sovereignty?**
> “Just as gods (or God) are not seen as bound by morality – since only a principle existing beyond good and evil could have created good and evil to begin with – so ‘divine kings’ cannot be judged in human terms; behaving in arbitrarily violent ways to anyone around them is itself proof of their transcendent status. Yet at the same time, they are expected to be creators and enforcers of systems of justice.”[^12]
- problem: this power is very hard to delegate, and therefore is intensely personal
- [[need an administrative system to extend this beyond the sovereign's immediate presence]]
	- even then, have to convince everyone to treat the royal representatives the same way
	- and, have to get the reps to do what they're told
	- and, get people to tell you if they aren't doing what they're told
- benevolence of this power dependent on being bottled up (in Natchez case)

**principle**: “containment of kings becomes one of the keys to their ritual power.”
- “People have an unfortunate tendency to see the successful prosecution of arbitrary violence as in some sense divine, or at least to identify it with some kind of transcendental power. ”
- **tokens of respect taken to the cosmological level:** “but insofar as such a figure does manage to establish themselves as genuinely standing above the law – in other words, as sacred or set apart – another apparently universal principle kicks in: in order to keep him apart from the muck and mire of ordinary human life, that same figure becomes surrounded with restrictions.”

### ¶ section break (396)

- none of these examples of First order regimes are "egalitarian"
	- all organized around an elite
	- yet, not clear how much that restricted freedoms

#uhoh uhoh, maybe Shilluk is 2nd order

#### Shilluk: another case of sovereignty without the state

#foreshadow [[reth]]s henchmen were "orphans, criminals, runaways and other unattached persons who would gravitate to him"

- whenever a reth tried to set up an admin apparatus, it was opposed by popular protest which ousted him or forced him to abandon the project entirely
- but, could not mobilize a lot of labor

### ¶ section break (397)

#### mobilizing labor?

- reth could not
- Olmec could
- Chavín could

- how did they do so? not clear if it was through chains of command (aka admin apparatus)
- (a point about corvee, that it could be festive)

#backshadow wait, have we been considering impact of first order regimes on the 3 basic forms of freedom? (move, disobey, associate)

#### impact of FOR on freedom type: social relations

- how did the "new" institutional arrangements and physical infrastructure come into being

**wtf is the transitioning here?**

## § how caring labor, ritual killing and ‘tiny bubbles’ all came together in the origins of ancient Egypt  (398)

## ∆ preparing for Second Order regimes

[ • • •]

### §

#### mass/ritual killings

`How to explain the pattern.`

- “Burials of kings surrounded by dozens, hundreds, on some occasions even thousands of human victims killed specially for the occasion can be found in almost every part of the world where monarchies did eventually establish themselves”
- most archaeologists treat mass killings as reliable indication that state formation under way
- consistent pattern: (??)
	- mark first generations of founding of new empire or kingdom
	- imitated by rivals in other elite households
	- practice fades
- description
	- initially, ritual killing around royal burial
	- "spectacular"
	- as if "death of a ruler meant brief moment when sovereignty breaks free of ritual fetters, triggering a political supernova that annihilates everything, including mighty individuals"
	- among victims
		- members of royal family
		- high-ranking military
		- high-ranking government officials
- given the "consistent pattern":
	- why did early kingdoms do it?
	- why did they stop once power established?

##### Anyang: victims are enemies

[[Anyang]]
- victims at royal burials were mostly war captives from rival lineages whose bodies were mutilated

[ • • •] [^13]

#aside “The ruler became a greater ancestor, in effect, by preventing others from becoming ancestors at all.”[^14]

##### Egypt: victims are family and retainers (really: strangers turned into family)

- on the surface, seems exactly opposite to Anyang
- victims at royal burials drawn from inner circles
- [ • • •]
- "On the death of a king, then, his successor appears to have presided instead over the death of his predecessor’s courtly entourage, or at least a sizeable portion of it."

##### Egypt: another paradox

> “On the one hand, we have a ritual that appears to be the ultimate expression of love and devotion, as those who on a day-to-day basis made the king into something king-like – fed him, clothed him, trimmed his hair, cared for him in sickness and kept him company when he was lonely – went willingly to their deaths, to ensure he would continue to be king in the afterlife. At the same time, these burials are the ultimate demonstration that for a ruler, even his most intimate subjects could be treated as personal possessions, casually disposed of like so many blankets, gaming boards or jugs of spelt.”

- mixed composition of royal cemeteries
	- blood relatives of early kings and queens
	- other individuals taken in owing to unusual skills or personal qualities, and seen as members of king's extended family
- violence: partly effaced the differences (between relatives and servants)
	- later, we see mini replicas of relatives doing manual labor

**When sovereignty first expands to become the general organizing principle of a society, it is by turning violence into kinship**[^15]
- lays the foundations of the [[patrimonial system]] ([[Max Weber]]'s term)
	- all subjects imagined as members of royal household, to the degree they care for the king
	- #zw so, they are murdered to that degree, too?

two sides of same coin

- turning strangers into part of royal house (Egypt)
- denying strangers their own ancestors (Anyang)

"a ritual designed to produce kinship becomes a method of producing kingship"

"patrimonial polity" expands "in terms of reshaping the lives of its internal subjects"
- royal estates divide the territory
	- each provisions mortuary cults of former rulers
	- then, entire "workers' towns" for construction of pyramids, getting corvee from entire country

##### Egypt: process of state formation: overview

- begins with Natchez-like principle of individual sovereignty
- bursts out of ritual cages through vehicle of sovereign's demise
- royal death is method for organizing "human life" in the territory

#transition And now we're going to look at this again? (how state formed, specifically)
#what

### § (403-408)

(we'll talk about corvee, workers towns, production-line techniques, subjects rendered into social machines)

Wengrow's book or paper:

- middle eastern neolithic, cultural focus on houses
- africa, cultural focus on bodies
	- fluid state of affairs

**how get from fluid state to First Dynasty** (3000 bc)
(during [[Predynastic]] and [[Proto-dynastic]] periods) (4th m bc, aka 4000-3000 bc)
- 3500 bc: burials of petty monarchs throughout Nile valley
	- very small kingdoms
- so before the First Dynasty there's actually a "superfluity" of sovereign power
	- tiny kingdoms and miniature courts
	- core of blood relatives
	- collection of henchmen, wives, servants, hangers-on
	- absolute, cosmological claims
	- no maintained admin or military control over territories
- again, how from **here** to "agrarian bureaucracy" of Egypt dynastic times
	- ~3500 bc, parallel process of change:
		- debate about responsibilities of living to dead
		- answer: (dead) ancestors get hungry, and require leavened bread and fermented wheat beer (at the time, exotic and even luxurious)
			- so you see the pot-containers show up all over the place in graves
			- arable wheat-farming, which was "familiar" previously, gets "refined and intensified"
- #backshadow (apparently should have been recognizing ) two processes: agronomic and ceremonial
	- mutually reinforcing
	- big social effects
	- created world's first peasantry
	- (remember that Neolithic populations liked floodplains, and that make it almost impossible to claim land, even if that had been cognitively available) - well, that was happening in Egypt too
		- but in this case, social requirements trumped ecology, and they went ahead and maintained those one-time divisions
			- requires
				- lots of arable land
				- ploughs and oxen
				- or, "networks of obligation and debt" for families that didn't have those resources and had to get bread and beer elsewhere
					- emergence of class dependencies and distinctions
					- many "deprived of means to care for ancestors"
- archaeological evidence
	- 3500 bc, baking/brewing facilities next to cemeteries
	- in few hundred years, next to palaces and grand tombs
	- (pot-baked bread and beer from single process)
- timeline
	- by [[Great Pyramids]] time (2500 bc) bread and beer produced on "industrial scale" for "armies" of workers during seasonal corvee for royal buildings (when they were fake relatives or care-givers of king)
- seasonal work units (production-line techniques that turned people into "great social machines" - conveyor-belt robots but with people), celebrating (material form of the divine blessings being passed down) together afterwards
	- "phyles"
	- men who passed through age-grade rituals
	- modeled on boat crew organization (parallels in team skills)
	- #aside parallel to [[Industrial Revolution]] where crews of people made into clock-like machines (first pioneered on sailing ships, then transfered to factories)
	-

similar thing in Inca Peru

- everyday food (freeze-dried potatoes)
- maize beer, for gods and "the food of empire"
	- maize became a ritual necessity for all classes
	- gods, armies, royal mummies
	- poor people in debt to royal estate

### ¶ (408-)

- above is world's first known "state formation"
- perhaps: “a combination of exceptional violence and the creation of a complex social machine, all ostensibly devoted to acts of care and devotion.”
- comparison of caring (family) and mechanical (machine, factory) labor
	- caring labor is "particular": understands unique qualities, needs of cared-for
		- "states" displace this caring "impulse" onto abstractions (usually "the nation" nowadays)
		- in Egypt, popular devotion (care) was diverted onto the abstraction of the "ruler and the elite dead"
	- mechanical labor …
- So (as in Egypt) you can imagine the process or arrangement as simultaneously a family and a machine
	- family: (also everyone interchangeable?)
	- machine: everyone interchangeable
- human activity directed "upwards"
	- generated "downward" flow of divine blessings and protection
		- material form: the "feasts" or "celebrations" mentioned above
- we can't easily apply this paradigm anywhere else
- this paradigm applied to:
	- Egypt, and Inca
	- similarities
		- *see p 409*

## § in which we reflect on the differences between what are usually called ‘early states’, from China to Mesoamerica (409-414)

### ¶ (409)

- other "early states" didn't take the sovereignty + bureaucracy + extension across territory approach

#### Early Dynastic Mesopotamia: project sovereignty onto cosmos

- #tidbit [cities] each with its own city gods who presided over local systems of temple administration.
- warriors (who claim to be representative of sovereign power in heaven)
- tension with: (this tension had originally been in conflict, as admin lowlands vs heroic highlands)
- city gods presiding over temple administration (warriors generally ruled the cities which had been around for centuries)
- #question what's being projected onto the cosmos here? oh, sovereignty ("sovereign power resides in heaven")

##### different forms of elements

- social class based on land tenure and mercantile wealth
- cities were banks and factories
- gods left temples for festivities
- priests made interest loans to traders, oversaw female weavers, guarded fields and flocks
- powerful societies of merchants

#### Maya lowlands: project administration onto cosmos

- the "principle of bureaucracy" is being "projected into the cosmos" (ie "in heaven")
	- no sophisticated admin on earth (would never occur to them to register numbers, wealth, birthdates of own subjects)
	- imagined cosmos as "a kind of administrative hierarchy", predictable laws, wheels within wheels, establish precise birthdates of deities
- grounded: Maya rulers were god-impersonators; tiny squabbling gods (aka sovereignty + individual heroics)

##### different forms of elements

- power (class?) based on ability to control flows of people and loyalty (rather than commerce as in Mesopotamia, see above)
	- through intermarriage, personal bonds b/t lords and sub nobles
	- hence, capturing high-status rivals as "human capital" (does not feature in Mesopotamia)

#### [ ???  ] : project heroic individualism onto cosmos

#### so called "early states" similarities

#question are we supposed to be drawing the correspondence to the elements here?
- spectacular violence "at the pinnacle of the system" (sovereignty)
- depend on / mimick patriarchal organization of household (heroic)
- government apparatus relies on class divisions  (admin?)
- but:
	- any of these elements could exist without or prior to central government
	- could take very different forms even when government established

#### late Shang China (1200-1000 bc), in Anyang

[ • • • first para ]
- differences from Inca and Old Kingdom Egypt
	- rulers didn't claim area sovereignty
		- they couldn't even travel safely outside narrow territory on Yellow River
		- evidence they didn't claim sovereignty: divination
- divination
	- any royal decision had to be approved by gods and ancestral spirits
	- diviners appealed through burnt offerings (proceedings quite **bureaucratic**)
		- first writing in china
		- no evidence used for anything else
		- didn't have elaborate bureaucratic apparatus
	- #thought why isn't anyone questioning what they consider evidence of, say, or how they characterize their three elements (like, is this *really* indicative of bureaucracy)
	- reading recorded and stamped and stored
- like Maya
	- rulers waged war to get human victims
	- Shang recognized as paramount, perhaps, but only incidentally, and other kingdoms went to war with them all the time
	- rulers still playing "heroic society"
- history
	- eventually [[Western Zhou]] defeated shang, claimed [[Mandate of Heaven]]

### ¶ (413-)

- not talking about "birth of the state" like a growing organism
- but instead talking about
	- broad regional systems
	- united for some time under single government
		- Egypt
		- Andes
- this (unitedness) (going back to thesis of this chapter) is unusual
	- more common, things like:
		- Shang China (unification theoretical)
		- Mesopotamia (regional hegemony only generation or two)
		- Maya (struggle between two power blocs)

#### Second-order regimes of domination

- Shang China
- Mesopotamia
	- admin and heroic politics
- Maya
	- sovereignty and heroic politics
- Egypt (early)
	- sovereignty and admin

- typically far more violent than First-order regimes
- two of three elements/principles combined "in some spectacular, unprecedented way"

> it’s not as if any of these principles, in their elementary forms, were entirely absent in any one case: in fact, what seems to have happened is that two of them crystallized into institutional forms – fusing in such a way as to reinforce one another as the basis of government – while the third form of domination was largely pushed out of the realm of human affairs altogether and displaced on to the non-human cosmos

## § in which we reconsider the Egyptian case in light of our three elementary principles of domination, and also revisit the problem of ‘dark ages (414-418)

### ¶

- Egyptian kingship the opposite of heroic violence on a certain axis
	- heroic order: warrior's honor based on possible loss (his reputation means so much he will risk everything (life, dignity, freedom))
	- egypt: couldn't conceivably lose
		- wars aren't "political contests" (between equals)
		- were: assertions of ownership; "rehearsals of the same sovereignty" (derived from kinship with gods)
			- combat
			- hunting chases
		- no sanctioned space for open competition (even though court intrigue obviously existed)
		- dramatic public contests non-existent (such as roman chariot-racing or Olmec or Zapotec ball games)
			- to the extent: royal jubilee was king racing *by himself* around a couple of pyramids or whatever
		- competitive politics *only* appears transposed to the cosmos, between the gods, [Contendings of Horus and Seth](Contendings%20of%20Horus%20and%20Seth.md)
			- "matters settled" by the time enters mortal domains

#tidbit no doubt there’s never been a royal court without jockeying for position, tricks and double-dealing and political intrigue

#### problem of absolute, personal (that is, pertaining to a person) sovereignty

- delegation
	- so state officials were considered "appendages of the king's own person"
	- obits describe life achievements only in terms of relationship to and care of king

- appears to be: (sovereignty + admin - competitive politics)

- #aside weird things about monarchy
	- historically pretty popular (lolish)
	- mobilize sentiments of caring nature and abject terror simultaneously
	- everyone rendered the same compared to king, who is ultimate abstraction
	- king's powers over mass violence and mass production
	- children are crucial players (infants only important in kingdoms and empires)

let's look at the "dark ages" ([First Intermediate Period](First%20Intermediate%20Period))

- when it's possible not to look at Egypt as early state
- "whenever state sovereignty broke down, heroic politics returned"
- hereditary aristocracy comes into its own (they came into conflict with principle of sovereignty, which is why they weren't in Old Kingdom)
- brag about taking care of people

**points**
- not "order to chaos" but "sovereignty" to "charismatic politics"
- with sov to char, shift from:
	- people care for god-like rulers, to
	- *care for the people* as a legitimate path to authority

## § in which we go in search of the real origins of bureaucracy, and find them on what appears to be a surprisingly small scale (418-)

### ¶

- why Egypt paradigm for state formation
	- chronologically earliest 2nd order regime
	- only case except Inca where it was sovereignty + administration
	- ie fits the model of what *should* have happened, and old enough
	- (goes back to [[theory of organization]] / certain social theory) we talked about
		- small can be egalitarian, but large numbers in city or kingdom changes things

most ancient emperors (non-admin) didn't care how cities did public works

what i presume we'll be talking about: "writing systems assumed to have developed in service of impersonal bureaucratic states"

- • • •
- when early regimes do have dominance: information, it's info we wouldn't consider practical (shamanism, divination)
	- BUT in fact, first "functional administration"[^16] emerge in these weird, ritual contexts
		- mesopotamian temples
		- egyptian ancestor cults
		- chinese oracle readings
- so bureaucracy DID NOT begin to solve information management when scale or complexity got too big

but if we're talking about the kind of bureaucratic technologies that these myths are talking about (specialized administrative control), the ones we recognize, they probably started in **very small** communities

#### Tell Sabi Abyad : small villages where our notion of bureaucracy emerged

[Tell Sabi Abyad](Tell%20Sabi%20Abyad.md), 6200 bc

- "village bureaucracy"
	- central storage facilities
		- granaries
		- warehouses
	- complex admin devices
		- economic archives (not written; writing not appear for 3,000 years)
		- geometric clay tokens
		- miniature engraved seals to stamp and mark clay stoppers
		- stoppers kept and archived for later reference
- community almost entirely uniform (housing)
	- small family units
	- complex division of labor (cooperation of multiple households)
		- pasturing flocks
		- cereal crops
		- flax for weaving
		- potting
		- bead-making
		- stone-carving
		- simple metalwork
		- family stuff (raise children, care for elderly)
		- maintain buildings
		- marriages and funerals
- regular interaction with "outsiders"
	- obsidian
	- metals
	- exotic pigments

still don't know why the measurement and archiving needed, tho

however, it's clear it had some effect

- in the 2,000 years between then and earliest cities, life in Middle East changed a lot
- people in small-scale communities acted as if living in mass societies
	- "culture areas" or hospitality zones, but based on "cultural uniformity" - #uniformity
		- a la "global village"

evidence

- 5000-4000 bc (5th millennium) ['Ubaid Period](Ubaid%20period.md)
- disappearance from village life of signs of difference or individuality
	- (admin tools and "media technologies" spread broadly)
	- houses built to standard plans
	- pottery, instead of expressing individual skill, made drab, uniform, and almost standardized
	- craft production becomes mechanical
	- female labor subjected to spatial control and segregation
- admin tools first designed to **prevent extraction and accumulation of wealth**[^17]

##### case study: Ayllu

[[Ayllu]]
- possible that [[khipu]] invented for mutually canceling out debt calculations
- explicit ideal of equality

##### dangers of accounting

- turned to other purposes
- system of equivalence underlying them can give an air of "Even-handedness and equity" to almost any social arrangement (including violent ones)
	- it's why sovereignty + admin so dangerous, you take equalizing effects and transform into social domination and tyranny

##### case study: Ayllu (continues)

- under Inca
- ayllus became "conquered women"
- khipus tracked labor debts owed to central Inca admin
	- fixed, non-negotiable, unlike in local cases
	- never unraveled and retied
- counter-myth
	- Inca not benevolent proto-socialists
		- admin structure extractive and exploitative
			- but still adept and precise!
		- community leaders become de facto state agents
			- either try to get rich
			- try to shield wards and selves
	- it was actually elements of ayllu system that persisted which provided "social security"

**fictions of legal equality**

so if Inca were so precise, why impose a standard system on everyone?

- this is part of the point
- could be how sovereignty "manifests itself in bureaucratic form"
	- ignore unique history
	- language of equity
	- ensure some always fail
	- always supply of peons, pawns, slaves
- re: first establishment of "bureaucratic empires almost always accompanied by some kind of system of equivalence run amok
	- societies like Uruk-period commercial and bureaucratic, since money and admin based on similar principles of "impersonal equivalence"

redefinition of "civilization"

### ¶ (433-436)

#### case study: Minoan Crete: women political power

[[The emergence of civilisation]] by [[Colin Renfrew]]

[[Knossos]]
[[Linear A]]
- "palatial society"
- no clear evidence of monarchy
	- absence of it in:
		- pictorial art
		- authority figures most often are adult women in boldly patterned skirts that extend over their shoulders but are open at the chest
			- women larger than men (superiority in nearby visual traditions)
			- hold symbols of command ([[Mother of Mountains]])
			- fertility rites
			- thrones
			- assemblies with no men presiding
			- flanked by monsters and dangerous animals
		- men depicted:
			- scantily clad or naked (no women are naked)
			- bringing tribute / subservience to female dignitaries
- without parallel in highly patriarchal societies nearby:
	- syria, lebanon, anatolia, egypt
	- and Cretans were familiar with
- wares imported from abroad:
	- trading people
	- traders mostly men
	- distinctively "female flavor":
		- egyptian sistra
		- cosmetic jars
		- figures of nursing mothers
		- scarab amulets
		- (come from rituals of non-royal Egyptian women and gynocentric rites of [[Hathor]])
		- (probably traveled with women's cults)
		- (women occupied the demand side of long-distance exchanges)
- Cretan palaces unfortified
- art makes no reference to war
	- refers to play and attention to creature comforts

##### case study: Throne Room of Knossos on Crete (compare to Megaron at Pylos below)
- throne faces open space
	- most likely seat of a council head, rather than male monarch
- stone benches arranged in rows, sit comfortably for a long time
	- all visible to one another
	- occupants probably female councillors
- stepped bathing chamber ("lustral basins")

- so much evidence to suggest female political rule (theocracy of college of priestesses)
- [[The Shapes of Minoan Desire]] by [[Jack Dempsey]]
	- erotic attention displayed from female body onto just about everything else
	- everything merges (zw: like at Cívan or whatever?) except for figures of leading women
	- everything else is "in the throes of a perpetual dance", even hills and mooountains
		- also a play on materials, mix of pottery into crusted shells, or stone, metal and clay
		- rhythms of the sea
	- opposite of politics: release from individuality, to erotic and spiritual, 
		- cosmos that nurtures and ignores individual
		- zw: so, the inverse of bureaucracy (though they contrast it with heroic politics)
	- no heroes, only players

### ¶ (436)

#### comparative case study: mainland Greece: not women political power(so we know what the opposite would look like) (1400 bc)

- Walled citadels
	- Mycenae
	- Pylos
	- Tiryns
- takeover of Crete (later than period described above)
- residences basically hill forts, perched on key passes
- warrior band and hunting retinue ("institutional foundation")
	- courtly finery from Cretan palaces
	- [[Linear B]] adapted to write Greek for administration
		- inspections done by a few, identifiable, literate officers
		- #tidbit distributing raw materials to artisans and supplying provisions for festivals.
		- limited and small-scale

##### case study: Megaron at Pylos (compare above)
- court in [[megaron]] (great hall)
	- one of Homer's kings would have felt at home here
	- huge hearth
	- open to sky
	- remainder of space, even throne, in shadow
	- frescoes on walls
		- bull to slaughter
		- bard playing lyre
		- processional scenes converge on throne (and [[wanax]] sitting on it)


### ¶ summary (438)
- what has been called "State formation" actually refers to very different things
- there's actualy logical and historical constraints on how "power can expand its scope"
	- limits = three principles
- uneven evidence
