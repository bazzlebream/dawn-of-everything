# Dawn of Everything Ch 2 Wicked Liberty (notes)

## 1. 0.1.

- rousseau's story about origins of social inequality ("freedoms are lost as societies grow bigger and more complex")
	- comes about as a theoretical refutation of the [indigenous critique](indigenous_critique.md) of European institutions

- Here we return to the matter with which we began: the European Enlightenment as the apotheosis of the principle of open and rational debate. ^[p 45]

#theme
- indigenous critique (about freedom/autonomy/mutual aid/communism/liberty) gets twisted into one about "equality" by [A. R. J. Turgot](Turgot.md)

#theme (from ch 3, so referring to this, chapter 2): In the last chapter, we suggested that the really insidious element of Rousseau’s legacy is not so much the idea of the ‘noble savage’ as that of the ‘stupid savage’. We may have got over the overt racism of most nineteenth-century Europeans, or at least we think we have, but it’s not unusual to find even very sophisticated contemporary thinkers who feel it’s more appropriate to compare ‘bands’ of hunter-gatherers with chimps or baboons than with anyone they’d ever be likely to meet.(p 92)

# 1. Rousseau didn't come up with it on his own

- Intellectual historians treat Rousseau like a [Great Man](great_man_theory_of_history.md), and like he "kicked off the debate" about social inequality
- however, he submitted an essay on the subject, which means at least it was going on enough to have an essay contest about it

#subchapter *in which we show how critiques of eurocentrism can backfire, and end up turning aboriginal thinkers into 'sock-puppets' ^[pp 28-37]

- history of the essay contest
	- 1754, [[Académie des Sciences, Arts et Belles-Lettres de Dijon]]: "announced a national essay competition on the question: ‘what is the origin of inequality among men, and is it authorized by natural law?"

# 2. the french academy didn't come up with this question (which is also a weird question for them to ask) out of the blue

#theme
- why was this an appropriate question for these people?
	- the question assumes already:
		- social inequality has an origin (takes for granted there was time when humans were equals)
		- and then something happened to change it
		- that the Ancien Regime pecking-order & servants situation was unnatural
	- starting given the circumstances
		- living in absolutist monarchy ([[Louis XV]])
		- almost every aspect of interaction was in hierarchies and rituals of deference
		- authors of essays had tons of servants
			- lived off patronage of dukes and bishops

# 3. setting the stage for how surprising it must have been when the backwater of Europe had to face all these new ideas from the New World

- look at France's place in the world
	- "shock and confusion" following Europe entering global economy relates to why "fascination with question of social inequality" new in the 1700s
- before entering global economy (some history)
	- in [Middle Ages](Middle_Ages.md), Europe considered a backwater "full of religious fanatics" who could be ignored in global trade and world politics
	- intellectuals there "rediscovering Aristotle" and history, and didn't know what anyone was thinking about anywhere else
- then in late 15th century, Portuguese fleets around Africa into Indian Ocean, and Spanish conquest of Americas
	- European kingdoms "in control" of huge portions of the world
	- Intellectuals exposed to all sorts of new ideas
	- ultimate result is now called the [Enlightenment](age_of_enlightenment.md)

# 4. the inverse arrogancies

## 2. Western thought arrogant (1)

- arrogancies of concept of [[Western thought]][^8]
	- as if WT was "so powerful and monolithic" as a set of ideas that it couldn't be influenced by anyone who wasn't a Great Man associated with it to begin with
		- examples
			- [Leibniz](gottfried_wilhelm_leibniz.md)'s advocacy for Chinese models of statecraft (which source he fully admitted) ended up being adopted by many European governments over 18th and 19th centuries
				- (ie, the adoption of these models clearly had something to do with the advocacy for Chinese models by Liebniz)
			- question of inequality
				- don't ask "[[what are the origins of social inequality]]"
				- but rather [what are the origins of the question about the origins of social inequality](what_are_the_origins_of_the_question_about_the_origins_of_social_inequality.md)
					- this way, we face a history of Europeans arguing about what foreign societies are like (eg [Eastern Woodlands of North America](eastern_woodlands_of_north_america.md))

## 3. Europeans debated Americans before Enlightenment on Enlightenment themes (interlude)

- specifics of this history of arguments
	- Europeans reference debates with indigenous Americans on themes central to later Enlightenment political thought:
		- nature of freedom
		- equality
		- rationality
		- revealed religion

## 4. it's arrogant to think Europeans listened (2)

- contemporary counter-(suggestions?)
	- indigenous people lived in a different universe or reality, as it were. Europeans reporting on their conversations were just projecting fantasies.
	- they levy accusations of **[[Western arrogance]]** (oh, the imperialists were listening to the people they would murder, huh?)
		- (but it is arrogance itself )
			- Europeans definitely had conversations with New World inhabitants
				- lived among them, even
				- (yes while planning/acting their destruction)
			- Europeans in europe later, who espoused freedom and equality (which weren't really even concepts known to them decades before) claims that the New World encounters influenced their thinking
			- so, denying Europeans were right is denying that indigenous people eoculdn't have made an impact on history
				- (**infantilizes non-Westerners**)

## 5. it's infantilizing to think Americans didn't affect history (3?)

- indigenous American scholars challenge the counter-(suggestions)
	- assumpting that all "parties" to the conversations were adults who, occasionally at the least, listened to each other
- what we'll see:
	- indigenous Americans develop own, consistent critique (the [indigenous critique](indigenous_critique.md)) of European institutions
	- critiques are taken seriously in Europe

# 5. (Also 4.5) Europeans did hear the critique, and many responded strongly, eventually making up what would be seen as Rousseau's idea (4?)

- European reception of [indigenous critique](indigenous_critique.md)
	- very serious
	- shock to the system
	- show possibilities for human freedom that couldn't be ignored
	- some saw as: menace to fabric of European society
		- whole body of theory mustered to oppose and refute
			- (basically, the meta-narrative of chapter 1 was made up)

(continues kind of on page 36 "the overwhelming majority still conclude …")

# 6. conceptual revolution

- The terms "inequality" and "equality" weren't even really used until the 1600s. [^inequalityterm]
- [Natural Law theory](natural_law_theory.md) took up the problem of what rights humans have merely by virtue of being human. This theorizing was necessary after conquistadors came back from the New World and people weren't totally on board with their wanton slaughter of indigenous people who posed no threat. One concept natural law theory came up with was the State of Nature, which served as a kind of imagined lifestyle of people as they were "naturally", that is, "all they had was their humanity".
- The concept of the [State of Nature](state_of_nature.md) allowed philosophers and social theorists to "skip past the biblical narratives" and ask what people were actually like in this State of Nature.
- They all basically came to the conclusion, by examining the "simplest societies" known, that the original state of humanity was "one of freedom and equality" (though not all of them (Hobbes) thought this was good).

Now (p 33) we're going to look at why they came to this odd conclusion

- First, for these people (natural law theorists and those who came after) it would have been strange to focus on these "apparently simple societies" as quintessential primordial sociality.
	- People without civilization were thought to have "degenerated". Previous authors would have seen "forest dwellers with no king" as fallen, in a sense. For previous authors, it was assumed that "all truly important knowledge" was given by God at the Beginning, and that they themselves were trying to recover lost knowledge. Therefore, simple societies would have looked like they were also subsequent, having lost (even more of) this information
		- [[José de Acosta]]
			- fallen vestiges of ancient civilization
			- refugees who had forgotten technologies like metallurgy and civil governance
		- [History in Renaissance Europe of 15th to 16th centuries](history_in_renaissance_europe_of_15th_to_16th_centuries.md)

- The concept of the [State of Nature](state_of_nature.md) gave conceptual traction to philosophers who would imagine people as "humanity in the raw" rather than "degenerate(d)".
- This allows new questions to be asked (questions which wouldn't have occurred to anyone to ask in the Renaissance version of history)
	- would there be social forms at all?
	- marriages?
	- people gregarious, or avoidant?
	- natural religion?

- A state of equality was not utterly inconceivable to European intellectuals before the eighteenth century. There were similar models available to people:
	- [Middle Ages folk egalitarianism](middle_ages_folk_egalitarianism.md) / [[equality before the law]][^23]
	- [res publica](res_publica.md)
		- "classical precedents" (but also classical precedents for the opposite)
- However, these few models don't explain that this became a universal assumption, of humans innocent of civilization in this state

- We have to return to the idea that Americans were fellow humans, which in part was because of their ability to make logical arguments in own defense.
- American intellectuals "played a role in this conceptual revolution"
- Recapitulation of the "scholarly arrogancies" from above (here on p 36)

#unpack  ?

#subchapter *in which we consider what the inhabitants of New France made of their European invaders, especially in matters of generosity, sociability, material wealth, crime, punishment and liberty* ^[pp 37-44]

- Going to:
	- examine accounts
	- get idea of what inhabitants did think of French societies
	- how this helped them form articulations of difference of own societies? or just think about own societies differently
	- IA developed strong critical view
		- FIRST focused on lack of freedom
		- LATER on equality

the Age of Reason debates and conversations "started" much earlier than is assumed

- [Age of Reason](age_of_enlightenment.md)
	- debate
	- conversation
	- texts were in dialogue form
		- (French wrote clearly back then)
	- appeal to "reason" was style of argument
- [[french_revolution]] ideals (liberty, equality, fraternity) only took form they did through these long debates and conversations

New France

- Neither the Americans nor French have much to say about "equality"
	- words égal or égalité barely show up
		- when they do, usually referring to "of the sexes"
- French on indigenous
- indigenous on French (competitiveness, selfishness, hostility to freedom)
	- reported by [[Father Pierre Biard]] of the [Mi'kmaq](mi_kmaq.md)
		- the French may have more material possessions, but the Mi'kmaw have other, better assets: "east, comfort, and time"
	- reported by [[Brother Gabriel Sagard, a Recollect Friar]] of the [Wendat](Wendat.md)
		- "by the end of his sojourn he had come to the conclusion their social arrangements were in many ways superior to those at home in France."
		- Wendat also looked down on French conversation[^9]
		- influential bestseller in Franch [[Le grande voyage du pays des Hurons]]
			- cited by Locke and Voltaire
	- reported in [[jesuit_relations_1633-1673]]
- taken for granted that Americans in free societies, and Europeans did not
	- differed: was individual liberty desirable?

- putting us in the mood: 17th century Europeans were not "like us" in a lot of ways
- (we're actually a lot closer to indigenous American attitudes)
	- personal freedom / individual liberty
		- **today**
			- everyone nowadays usually says (formally) they are for freedom
			- "lasting legacies of Enlightenment and American and French Revolutions"
			- personal freedom inherently good
		- 17th century Jesuits
			- individual liberty was animalistic
				- [[Le Jeune]] on the [[Montagnais-Naskapi]] in 1642
					- "the liberty of wild ass colts"
			- outrageous that you couldn't convert wealth into power (see p 43)
			- Jesuits opposed to freedom in principle ([[Father Lallemant]])
			- "wicked liberty of the savages"
			- "Even finding terms to translate concepts like 'lord', 'commandment' or 'obedience' into indigenous languages was extremely difficult"
		- [Montagnais-Naskapi](Montagnais-Naskapi)
			- French were basically slaves, in constant terror of superiors
			- (these ideas from nomadic bands, but also townsfolk like Wendat)
				- and even Wendat statesmen would admit they couldn't get anyone to do anything they didn't want to
	- equality of men and women
	- sexual mores
	- popular sovereignty
	- theories of depth psychology[^10]

- Gives an idea of how "politically challenging" the material in the [Jesuit Relations (1633-1673)-1673](jesuit_relations_1633-1673.md) must have been to Europeans
	- had to admit that Wendat system of justice was effective, even though they didn't kill murderers and thieves
		- compensation payments from clan or lineage; that way everyone has to keep kin under control
		- the whole country might assemble to agree on the compensation due to "stay vengeance"

- things to note (that i didn't mention above)
	- some people were clearly wealthy
		- Wendat society not "economically egalitarian"; but this was wealth like wampum and other "political" treasures, rather than economic resources, like land, which was owned by families and collectives
		- Wendat men hoarded these in order to be able to give them away

#theme turn access to material resources into power (power to allow one to make others work for you, or compel them to do anything they did not wish to do)^[p 43]

Wendat didn't have way to do that with land/agricultural products, or wampus-style objects

- at best (worst) riches (accumulation AND distribution) might make likely to run for political office
	- but merely holding office didn't give you right to give anyone orders and have them obeyed

#subchapter *in which we show how Europeans learned from (native) Americans about the connection between reasoned debate, personal freedoms and the refusal of arbitrary power* ^[pp 44-48]

# 7. defining equality in two senses

[two definitions of equality](two_definitions_of_equality.md)

# 8. why the Enlightenment is associated with a certain talking style

- why were Americans so good at debating (p 45) (or … persuading)
	- Jesuits saw intrinsic relations between "refusal of arbitrary powers" and "open political debate"
- persuading: (oh, G&W mean rhetorical techniques)
	- doesn't have to be logical argumentation
	- appeal to sentiment
	- whipping up passions
	- poetic metaphors
	- myth
	- common wisdom
	- irony and indirection
	- humor
	- insult
	- appeals to prophecy or revelation
- the Wendat preferred the "reasoned debate" tactic (rational, sceptical, empirical, conversational in tone)
	- this is the kind of debate associated with the [Enlightenment](age_of_enlightenment.md)
	- so Jesuits and Enlightenment thinkers and revolutionaries saw this to be innately connected with "rejection of arbitrary authority" (esp of the clergy)

- 1650
	- French missionaries try to evangelize "New France" (Nova Scotia and Quebec )
	- European thinkers got egalitarian State of Nature concept
	- terms "(in)equality" just starting to get used commonly in intellectual circles
	- reading public interested in "primordial societies"
- not until "dialogic encounter":
	- see people in State of Nature as "noble" (in sense of being like nobles, hunting and aristocrats, and then later the newer sense)
	- see people as rational sceptics and "champions of individual liberty"

- talking about "equality"
	- New France colonists, nor indigenous Americans, didn't use "equality"
- rather, talked about "liberty" and "mutual aid", aka "freedom" and "communism"

- term: communism
	- since early 1800s, debates about existence of something called "primitive communism"
		- brought up [[Northeast Woodlands]] societies
			- (ever since [Friedrich Engels](friedrich_engels.md) used the Iroquois as a prime example of primitive communism in his [The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (1884)](origin_of_the_family_private_property_and_the_state_1884.md)
	- in this period, (property regime definition) communism means communal ownership, esp of productive resources
		- as applied to America
			- many American societies "ambiguous" as regards communism as communal ownership
				- women owned and worked fields individually
				- stored and disposed of products collectively
				- men owned tools and weapons individually
				- shared out game and spoils
	- another meaning:
		- not as property regime
		- "original sense" communism: from each / to each
	- another: [baseline communism](baseline_communism.md)
		- how far baseline communism extends is uh … what varies (in … ?)

class between very different concepts of **individualism**

- baseline communism very restricted in 17th century French
	- squabbling
- [Northeast Woodlands](Northeast%20Woodlands), and many societies, inconceivable to refuse a request for food
	- guaranteed means to autonomous life
	- or ensure no one subordinated to another
	- communism **in support of** individual freedom
- [[Great Lakes region]]
	- similar

*only over time* did "no one's will subordinated to another" become talking about "equality"

#subchapter *in which we introduce the Wendat philosopher-statesman Kandiaronk, and explain how his views on human nature and society took on new life in the salons of enlightenment Europe (including an aside on the concept of ‘schismogenesis’)* ^[pp 48-59]

# 9. proto-Enlightenment salons with Kandiaronk (aka yeah Lahontan's accounts were really quoting Kandiaronk)

- story of [Lahontan](Lahontan.md) and [Kandiaronk](Kandiaronk.md)
	- [Curious Dialogues with the Savage of Great Wisdom Who Has Traveled](Curious_dialogues_with_a_savage_of_great_wisdom_and_sense_who_has_traveled.md)
		- critical opinions of European mores
			- ideas about religion
			- politics
			- health
			- sexual life
	- pretty clear that these were actually statements and beliefs of Kandiaronk/Adario, and not just Lahontan with another agenda, like getting criticisms past Church censorship
		- [[Barbara Alice Mann]]: "excellent reason for accepting them as genuine"
- [[Count de Frontenac]] proto-Enlightenment salon, Kandiaronk as rational sceptic

## 6. new move: "organization of private property" enters into things[^11] = theme (translate wealth into power) || also, equality finally articulated?

- came from Americans observing French society up close

#theme Whereas in their own societies there was no obvious way to convert wealth into power over others (with the consequence that differences of wealth had little effect on individual freedom), in France the situation could not have been more different. Power over possessions could be directly translated into power over other human beings.[^12]

[The Dialogues](Curious_dialogues_with_a_savage_of_great_wisdom_and_sense_who_has_traveled.md)
- the term "equality" is "invoked as a self-conscious ideal" only after a great deal of dialogic confrontation (perhaps at least the six years Kandiaronk has been studying Europe)

just because Kandiaronk and his assertions are exaggerated, don't mean he's a projection of fantasy[^13]

## 7. schismogenesis

- [schismogenesis](schismogenesis), but considered inter-society (that is, between societies rather than within a society)
	- people define selves against neighbors
		- urbanites vs barbarians
	- [[national character]]: if it exists, it *can only be as a result of such processes*
		- (if nothing else, they will exaggerate differences in arguing)

- let's look at "historical confrontation of civilizations" in 17th century North America through this lens
	- two contradictory processes:
		- people on both sides learn from each other, adopt ideas, habits, technologies
		- pick out certain points of contrast and exaggerate or idealize them (trying to act as little like each other as possible)
			- eg. Kandiaroni's focus on money ;[^14] modern day indigenous societies frame tradition by opposition to "living in the way of money"

- ???
	- kandiaronk translated into most European languages, and in print for over 100 years
	- any smarty from 1700s would have read them
	- imitations:
		- [[L'Arlequin sauvage (play)]] - revived almost yearly for 20 years
		- French thinkers did their own Lahontan-style critiques of own society, from POV of imagined outsider (origin of Western gaze ?)
			- [[Montesquieu]]
			- [[Marquis d'Argens]]
			- [[Diderot]]
			- [[Chateaubriand]]
			- [Voltaire](Voltaire.md)
			- [Letters of Peruvian Woman](Letters_from_a_Peruvian_Woman.md)
				- response to Graffigny's request for 2nd edition changes suggestions, [Turgot](Turgot.md)'s criticisms lead to his [Turgot's theory of history](turgot_theory_of_history.md)

#subchapter *in which we explain the demiurgic powers of A. R. J. Turgot, and how he turned the indigenous critique of European civilization on its head, laying the basis for most modern views of social evolution (or: how an argument about ‘freedom’ became one about ‘equality’)*^[pp 59-62]

1. step 1, indigenous critique (freedom) becomes stages of evolution (mode of subsistence)

- in [Letters of Peruvian Woman](Letters_from_a_Peruvian_Woman.md), Graffigny represents [Inca empire](inca_empire.md) as a "benevolent despotism" and the "equality before the law" [definition of equality](two_definitions_of_equality.md) - Zilia's critique was of "lack of individual freedom" in French society "and violent inequalities"

- [A. R. J. Turgot](Turgot.md) thought it was dangerous thinking
- [[response letter]]
	- we all love freedom and equality in principle (I guess he started off using both?)
	- in reality, freedom and equality of savages is sign of inferiority[^24]
		- only possible where each household self-sufficient, and everyone equally poor
	- as societies evolve, tech advances
	- complex divisions of labor arise from individual differences
	- simple societies progress to "commercial civilizations" (complex)
		- poverty is necessary condition for prosperity
	- you can't avoid that inequality
		- only alternative is "enforced equality" like Inca state intervention
			- this would crush initiative, result in socioeconomic catastrophe
			- ie "an Inca-style totalitarianism that could only be enforced through revolutionary terror."[^17]
- [intervening period]
	- primacy of tech progress as driver for overall social improvement
- [[lectures on world history]]
	- developed argument into explicit [theory of stages of economic development](turgot_theory_of_history.md)
	- thus, theories of social evolution emerged as "direct response to … indigenous critique"
- soon:
	- [Adam Smith](adam_smith.md) using these four stages in own lectures
	- in [[Scottish Enlightenment general theory of human history]] by Lord Kames, Adam Ferguson, John Millar
	- **affected how Europeans thought of indigenous people**
		- changed from:
			- people used to not think modes of subsistence and division of labor were very important
			- now thought that they were all that mattered
		- sort everyone on evolutionary ladder, depending on how they got food
			- puts egalitarian societies at the bottom
			- can't be "equal parties" to considering how wealthy societies should act

1703-1751
- indigenous critique
	- goes from widespread outrage to "an argument about the nature of authority, decency, social responsibility and, above all, freedom."[^15]
	- French realize that indigenous put individual autonomy and freedom of action above other values
		- (corollary: minimize possibility of one person subordinating another)
	- Indigenous critique is POWERFUL
	- French reaction
		- Jesuits condemn principle of freedom
		- public and intellectuals: it's provocative and appealing! (though they may not have cared if the people themselves were mass murdered)
	- (once outrage then) "freedom" argument became about "equality"
	- appeal to wisdom of savages and challenge received authority?
	- latecomers: Turgot's notions of civilization, evolution, and progress (direct response to POWER of critique)
	- how to salvage European sense of superiority? (in part, by invoking the ideas of the critique as thought they came from EUrope?)
		- weird side effect of having European colonial empires say they were just catalysts to accelerate subject's climb up the ladder (catalysts, and thus temporary)

#subchapter *how jean-jacques rousseau, having won one prestigious essay competition, then lost another (coming in over the permitted word length), but finally went on to conquer the whole of human history* ^[pp 63-67]

1750s intellectual debate:
- freedom and equality universal values?
- or inconsistent with private property regime
- did progress of art and science lead to moral progress/wealth/power, or was France's power just side effect of pathological social arrangements?

Back to top:

- [Discourse on Inequality](discourse_on_inequality.md) is an outlier, even at the time

Coming around:

- Rousseau's first essay contest: restoration of sciences and arts contributed to moral improvement?
	- Rousseau 1st prize [[Discourse on the arts and sciences - Rousseau (1750)]]
		- "they have not"
		- elementary moral institutions are decent and sound
		- civilization corrupts, getting us to value form over content
		- examples from Greek and Roman classical sources
			- in footnotes, hints at Americans (what's his point in this quote?)
	- in other words, **top honors awarded to argument that said arts and sciences were counterproductive** (from an arts and sciences academy)
- Rousseau wrote responses to criticisms over next few years
	- also writes opera [[The Village Soothsayer]]
- 1754, new contest, origins of social inequality
	- Rousseau's more elaborate treatise, and rejected for being too long

G&W analyze the essay:

- odd
- doesn't argue that human society begins in idyllic innocence
- actually argues that first humans were good, but avoided one another because they were afraid of violence (but also … if they were solitary, they were "radically" autonomous (G&W words))
- as a result, State of Nature humans were solitary
	- **so, he can argue that "society" (ongoing association between individuals) was a restraint on freedom** (ie. relationships are restriction on liberty)
	- even language was a compromise
- (real innovation): bad news at the moment **property** relations emerge ("fall from grace")
- his THOUGHT EXPERIMENT / PARABLE model of society:
	- three stages (each marking moral decline)
		- purely imaginary State of Nature (marked by isolation)
		- Stone Age (Savagery, following language - includes Americans)
		- Civilization (following agriculture and metallurgy)
- parable meant to emphasize how humans accepted notion of private property at all:
	- […] Rousseau: first man enclosing piece of property, founded civil society and did a bad. however, though it looks like a spontaneous act, it didn't come out of nowhere, since "the idea of property, depending on many prior ideas which could only have arisen in successive stages, was not formed all at once in the human mind."
	- when ancestors decided to divide earth, this is the "headlong into their chains" bit (Even tho they thought it would preserve their liberty)
- #theme *?????* Rousseau asks "how Europeans able to turn wealth into power; unequal distribution of materials goods (extant everywhere to some degree) into orders, servants, workmen, or not caring if they died?"[^16]
??
- familiar with lahontan and [Jesuit Relations (1633-1673)](jesuit_relations_1633-1673.md)
- asks same questions
	- why are Europeans so competitive
	- why don't they share (food)
	- why submit to orders
	- excursus on *[pitié](pitie.md)*
- even tho essay rejected, was obviously very successful. why?
	- (ok, so, yes, sensationalist)
	- **clever compromise between contradictory positions**:
		- elements of indigenous critique
			- agrees with Kandioaronk that Europeans atrocious creature
			- (critique of private property) property is root of the problem (i think G&W say something about this being developed through schismogenesis)
		- biblical narrative of the Fall
		- evolutionary states of material development
	- BUT Rousseau can't imagine society being based on anything but property (his different from Kandiaronk)
		- that is, loses the sense of possibility that society could be based on something else
			- a casualty of translating conceptually for French philosophers
- conceptions of individual freedom
	- for Kandioaronk et al, individual liberty and communism were not contradictory, they were mutually supportive: people who are starving aren't really "free" to do much of anything
	- European (more fully explained in later chapters)
		- tied to notions of private property
			- legally: power of male household head in ancient rome (Freedom is exercised to the cost of others)
			- rome & europe: **self-sufficiency of households** #theme (we saw above), so true freedom ws autonomy in the *radical* sense: not just free will (autonomy of the will) but being in no way dependent on other humans, except those one controlled or owned
- Rousseau did insist he wished to live without being dependent (Even while having servants and mistresses) played out that same logic in his own life
	- what would R have felt the "lost" liberty looked like? esp if any relationship is a restraint on liberty

#theme How did Rousseau's weird vision come to define our current mindset?

#subchapter *in which we consider relationships between the indigenous critique, the myth of progress and the birth of the left* ^[pp 67-71]

# 10. Rousseau and the modern Left and Right, ish

Rousseau blamed by conservatives after [French Revolution](french_revolution.md)

	(parts of this reproduced in [Chapter 12](dawn_of_everything_ch_12_notes.md))
	- trying to restore ancient liberty/equality lead to Inca-style totalitarianism
	

Rousseau embraced by American Rev and French Rev political radicals

- weird digression on the [Secret Order of the Illuminati](secret_order_of_the_illuminati.md),[^18] banned in 1785
- right-wing conspiracists "insisted" it survived, and that [the Illuminati](secret_order_of_the_illuminati.md) were behind French and Russian revolutions
- (silly, yes, but Illuminati probably first who suggested that a revolutionary vanguard, trained in orthodoxy, could understand and speed up the overall direction of human history)

1750s intellectual debates are so odd because modern left/right divisions hadn't crystallized

at 1776 ([[American Revolution]] times), terms "left" and "right" didn't exist (well, in that sense)

only produces in that sense after French National Assembly of 1789 (respective seating areas of aristocrats and popular factions)

Rousseau "wrote the founding document of the left as an intellectual project"

- in combining:
	- indigenous critique, and
	- doctrine of progress (originally) developed to counter it

Right-wing thought:

- suspicious of idea of progress
- tradition emerging from indigenous critique
- … what's happening here

… not sure how to integrate --->

- [racist denigration of savage] and [naive celebration of savage innocence], treated like two sides of same (imperialist) coin
- however, originally this (?) was right-wing position
	- [[Ter Ellingson]] [[The myth of the noble savage]]
		- never was a noble savage myth (not in sense of stereotype of simple societies living in age of happy primordial innocence)
		- rather travelers were ambivalent: alien societies were complicated, incoherent, mixes of bad and good

should investigate: myth of "the myth of the noble savage"

- why did Europeans attribute such a naive position to others/
- "noble savage" popularized after 1859, as a slur, deployed by outright racists who took over British Ethnological Society and called for genocide of inferior people
	- these guys blamed Rousseau (for coming up with the term?)
	- (i'm not sure who the pronouns refer to in this section)

- Ter Ellingson researching Chinard:
	- [[Gilbert Chinard]]- i'm guessing a right-wing racist genocider?
		- Lahontan resembles Rousseau
		- both are equally passionate, enthusiastic, anarchists with ignoble motives and bereft of moral sensibility
			- they imagine themselves persecuted minorities, indignant about suffering, and calls to arms
			- he attributes to property all evils
	- Ellingson:
		- wtf is Chinard talking about? he basically thinks there's an anarchist plot organized by Lahontan, the Jesuits, and Rousseau
			- Jesuits: made us think well of "savages"
				- (which the state and religion didn't want?)
		- irrelevant to Chinard if indigenous viewers were accurately represented
			- to Chinard, they were a completely different race that it was impossible to have meaningful relations
			- the only thing that matters are the motives of white people and, of those three, they were "malcontents and troublemakers"

wtf is going on here

(right-wing critique morphed into left-wing critique?)

#subchapter *beyond the ‘myth of the stupid savage’ (why all these things matter so much for our project in this book)* ^[pp 71-77]

# 11. reluctance to engage with indigenous sources (pushing them into conceptual space where judgments no longer threatening)

- #tidbit "To say Mi’kmaq thought is unimportant would be racist; to say it’s unknowable because the sources were racist, however, does rather let one off the hook"
- but also based on legitimate protests of the romanticized (ie the indigenous)[^19]

## 8. more imaginative or not imaginative?

- Rousseau sidestepped the question (of the essay: what are the origins of social inequality?) by "reducing his savages to mere thought experiments"
	- notably didn't write one of the dialogues-looking-at-europe-from-indigenous-critique
	- savages don't have any imaginative powers at all
		- they are solitary loners who don't want relationships?
		- and can't project into future in any way
		- have no philosophy
		- presumably why no one foresaw how horrible things would be when they divided up property
- [Pierre Clastres](pierre_clastres.md): the opposite is the case
	- simple people are actually more imaginative
		- we can't picture a free society, but they have no problem picturing arbitrary power
		- "he did more to reverse the damage than anyone before or since"

## 9. Rousseau's legacy?

- didn't actually promote "noble savage" myth
- promulgated "myth of the stupid (if blissful) savage" (their new term)
	- adopted by 19th century imperialists, who added "scientific" justifications to elaborate on what "innocent simplicity" meant => pushing them into conceptual space where judgements no longer threatening
		- Darwinian evolutionism
		- "scientific" racism

# 12. problems with defining equality?

- it is still completely unclear what "egalitarian" means (and "equal")
- instead, let's examine why it's used
	- NOT because it has analytical substance (it doesn't)
	- RATHER because[^20] "equality" is a default term: the mass of humanity imagined when "trappings of civilization" are stripped away[^21]
		- "egalitarian" people are those WITHOUT the most obvious tokens of inequality (princes, judges, overseers, priests, cities, writing, farming)
- so, if you're writing about the "origins of inequality", you're automatically writing about these tokens of inequality and "trappings of civilization"

# 13. the project

- we still want to understand how things (like the so-called signs of inequality) first came about
- however, we won't be treating ancestors like a "primordial human soup" in order to do that
	- look at what they thought was important in their societies
	- describing them as "egalitarian" tells us nothing
- But self-conscious ideas of ‘equality’, putting equality forward as an explicit value (as opposed to an ideology of freedom, or dignity, or participation that applies equally to all) appear to have been relative latecomers to human history. And even when they do appear, they rarely apply to everyone.[^22]
