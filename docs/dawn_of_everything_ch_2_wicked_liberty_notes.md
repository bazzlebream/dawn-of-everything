# Dawn of Everything: Ch 2: Wicked Liberty (notes)

- rousseau's story about origins of social inequality ("freedoms are lost as societies grow bigger and more complex")
	- comes about as a theoretical refutation of the [indigenous critique](indigenous_critique.md) of European institutions

- Here we return to the matter with which we began: the European Enlightenment as the apotheosis of the principle of open and rational debate. ^[p 45]

## 1. Rousseau didn't come up with it on his own

- Intellectual historians treat Rousseau like a [Great Man](great_man_theory_of_history.md), and like he "kicked off the debate" about social inequality
- however, he submitted an essay on the subject, which means at least it was going on enough to have an essay contest about it

#subchapter *in which we show how critiques of eurocentrism can backfire, and end up turning aboriginal thinkers into 'sock-puppets' ^[pp 28-37]

- history of the essay contest
	- 1754, [[Académie des Sciences, Arts et Belles-Lettres de Dijon]]: "announced a national essay competition on the question: ‘what is the origin of inequality among men, and is it authorized by natural law?"

## 2. the french academy didn't come up with this question (which is also a weird question for them to ask) out of the blue

#theme
- why was this an appropriate question for these people?
	- the question assumes already:
		- social inequality has an origin (takes for granted there was time when humans were equals)
		- and then something happened to change it
		- that the Ancien Regime pecking-order & servants situation was unnatural
	- starting given the circumstances
		- living in absolutist monarchy ([[Louis XV]])
		- almost every aspect of interaction was in hierarchies and rituals of deference
		- authors of essays had tons of servants
			- lived off patronage of dukes and bishops

## 3. (not sure how to fit this in yet)

- look at France's place in the world
	- "shock and confusion" following Europe entering global economy relates to why "fascination with question of social inequality" new in the 1700s
- before entering global economy (some history)
	- in [Middle Ages](Middle_Ages.md), Europe considered a backwater "full of religious fanatics" who could be ignored in global trade and world politics
	- intellectuals there "rediscovering Aristotle" and history, and didn't know what anyone was thinking about anywhere else
- then in late 15th century, Portuguese fleets around Africa into Indian Ocean, and Spanish conquest of Americas
	- European kingdoms "in control" of huge portions of the world
	- Intellectuals exposed to all sorts of new ideas
	- ultimate result is now called the [Enlightenment](age_of_enlightenment.md)

## 4. the inverse arrogancies

### 4.1. Western thought arrogant (1)

- arrogancies of concept of [[Western thought]][^8]
	- as if WT was "so powerful and monolithic" as a set of ideas that it couldn't be influenced by anyone who wasn't a Great Man associated with it to begin with
		- examples
			- [Leibniz](gottfried_wilhelm_leibniz.md)'s advocacy for Chinese models of statecraft (which source he fully admitted) ended up being adopted by many European governments over 18th and 19th centuries
				- (ie, the adoption of these models clearly had something to do with the advocacy for Chinese models by Liebniz)
			- question of inequality
				- don't ask "[[what are the origins of social inequality]]"
				- but rather [what are the origins of the question about the origins of social inequality](what_are_the_origins_of_the_question_about_the_origins_of_social_inequality.md)
					- this way, we face a history of Europeans arguing about what foreign societies are like (eg [Eastern Woodlands of North America](eastern_woodlands_of_north_america.md))

### 4.2. Europeans debated Americans before Enlightenment on Enlightenment themes (interlude)

- specifics of this history of arguments
	- Europeans reference debates with indigenous Americans on themes central to later Enlightenment political thought:
		- nature of freedom
		- equality
		- rationality
		- revealed religion

### 4.3. it's arrogant to think Europeans listened (2)

- contemporary counter-(suggestions?)
	- indigenous people lived in a different universe or reality, as it were. Europeans reporting on their conversations were just projecting fantasies.
	- they levy accusations of **Western arrogance** (oh, the imperialists were listening to the people they would murder, huh?)
		- (but it is arrogance itself )
			- Europeans definitely had conversations wtih New World inhabitants
				- lived among them, even
				- (yes while planning/acting their destruction)
			- Europeans in europe later, who espoused freedom and equality (which weren't really even concepts known to them decades before) claimes that the New World encounters influenced their thinking
			- so, denying Europeans were right is denying that indigenous people eoculdn't have made an impact on history
				- (**infantilizes non-Westerners**)

### 4.4. it's infantilizing to think Americans didn't affect history (3?)

- indigenous American scholars challenge the counter-(suggestions)
	- assumpting that all "parties" to the conversations were adults who, occasionally at the least, listened to each other
- what we'll see:
	- indigenous Americans devleop own, consistent critique (the [indigenous critique](indigenous_critique.md)) of EUropean institutions
	- critiques are taken seriously in Europe

### 4.5. Europeans did hear the critique, and many responded strongly, eventually making up what would be seen as Rousseau's idea (4?)

- European reception of [indigenous critique](indigenous_critique.md)
	- very serious
	- shock to the system
	- show possibilities for human freedom that couldn't be ignored
	- some saw as: menace to fabric of European society
		- whole body of theory mustered to oppose and refute
			- (basically, the meta-narrative of chapter 1 was made up)

(continues kind of on page 36 "the overwhelming majority still conclude …")

## 5. conceptual revolution

- The terms "inequality" and "equality" weren't even really used until the 1600s. [^inequalityterm]
- [Natural Law theory](natural_law_theory.md) took up the problem of what rights humans have merely by virtue of being human. This theorizing was necessary after conquistadors came back from the New World and people weren't totally on board with their wanton slaughter of indigenous people who posed no threat. One concept natural law theory came up with was the State of Nature, which served as a kind of imagined lifestyle of people as they were "naturally", that is, "all they had was their humanity".
- The concept of the [State of Nature](state_of_nature.md) allowed philosophers and social theorists to "skip past the biblical narratives" and ask what people were actually like in this State of Nature.
- They all basically came to the conclusion, by examining the "simplest societies" known, that the original state of humanity was "one of freedom and equality" (though not all of them (Hobbes) thought this was good).

Now (p 33) we're going to look at why they came to this odd conclusion

- First, for these people (natural law theorists and those who came after) it would have been strange to focus on these "apparently simple societies" as quintessential primordial sociality.
	- People without civilization were thought to have "degenerated". Previous authors would have seen "forest dwellers with no king" as fallen, in a sense. For previous authors, it was assumed that "all truly important knowledge" was given by God at the Beginning, and that they themselves were trying to recover lost knowledge. Therefore, simple societies would have looked like they were also subsequent, having lost (even more of) this information
		- [[José de Acosta]]
			- fallen vestiges of ancient civilization
			- refugees who had forgotten technologies like metallurgy and civil governance
		- [History in Renaissance Europe of 15th to 16th centuries](history_in_renaissance_europe_of_15th_to_16th_centuries.md)

- The concept of the [State of Nature](state_of_nature.md) gave conceptual traction to philosophers who would imagine people as "humanity in the raw" rather than "degenerate(d)".
- This allows new questions to be asked (questions which wouldn't have occurred to anyone to ask in the Renaissance version of history)
	- would there be social forms at all?
	- marriages?
	- people gregarious, or avoidant?
	- natural religion?

- A state of equality was not utterly inconceivable to European intellectuals before the eighteenth century. There were similar models available to people:
	- [Middle Ages folk egalitarianism](Middle%20Ages%20folk%20egalitarianism.md)
	- [res publica](res_publica.md)
	- "classical precedents" (but also classical precedents for the opposite)
- However, these few models don't explain that this became a universal assumption, of humans innocent of civilization in this state

We have to return to the idea that Americans were fellow humans, which in part was because of their ability to make logical arguments in own defense.

- American intellectuals "played a role in this conceptual revolution"

Recapitulation of the "scholarly arrogancies" from above (here on p 36)

#unpack  ?

#subchapter *in which we consider what the inhabitants of New France made of their European invaders, especially in matters of generosity, sociability, material wealth, crime, punishment and liberty* ^[pp 37-44]

- Going to:
	- examine accounts
	- get idea of what inhabitants did think of French societies
	- how this helped them form articulations of difference of own societies? or just think about own societies differently
	- IA developed strong critical view
		- FIRST focused on lack of freedom
		- LATER on equality

the Age of Reason debates and conversations "started" much earlier than is assumed

- [Age of Reason](age_of_enlightenment.md)
	- debate
	- conversation
	- texts were in dialogue form
		- (French wrote clearly back then)
	- appeal to "reason" was style of argument
- [[French Revolution]] ideals (liberty, equality, fraternity) only took form they did through these long debates and conversations

New France

- Neither the Americans nor French have much to say about "equality"
	- words égal or égalité barely show up
		- when they do, usually referring to "of the sexes"
- French on indigenous
- indigenous on French (competitiveness, selfishness, hostility to freedom)
	- reported by [[Father Pierre Biard]] of the [Mi'kmaq](mi_kmaq.md)
		- the French may have more material possessions, but the Mi'kmaw have other, better assets: "east, comfort, and time"
	- reported by [[Brother Gabriel Sagard, a Recollect Friar]] of the [Wendat](Wendat.md)
		- "by the end of his sojourn he had come to the conclusion their social arrangements were in many ways superior to those at home in France."
		- Wendat also looked down on French conversation[^9]
		- influential bestseller in Franch [[Le grande voyage du pays des Hurons]]
			- cited by Locke and Voltaire
	- reported in [[jesuit_relations_1633-1673]]
- taken for granted that Americans in free societies, and Europeans did not
	- differed: was individual liberty desirable?

- putting us in the mood: 17th century Europeans were not "like us" in a lot of ways
- (we're actually a lot closer to indigenous American attitudes)
	- personal freedom / individual liberty
		- **today**
			- everyone nowadays usually says (formally) they are for freedom
			- "lasting legacies of Enlightenment and American and French Revolutions"
			- personal freedom inherently good
		- 17th century Jesuits
			- individual liberty was animalistic
				- [[Le Jeune]] on the [[Montagnais-Naskapi]] in 1642
					- "the liberty of wild ass colts"
			- outrageous that you couldn't convert wealth into power (see p 43)
			- Jesuits apposed to freedom in principle ([[Father Lallemant]])
			- "wicked liberty of the savages"
			- "Even finding terms to translate concepts like 'lord', 'commandment' or 'obedience' into indigenous languages was extremely difficult"
		- [Montagnais-Naskapi](Montagnais-Naskapi)
			- French were basically slaves, in constant terror of superiors
			- (these ideas from nomadic bands, but also townsfolk like Wendat)
				- and even Wendat statesmen would admit they couldn't get anyone to do anything they didn't want to
	- equality of men and women
	- sexual mores
	- popular sovereignty
	- theories of depth psychology[^10]

- Gives an idea of how "politically challenging" the material in the [Jesuit Relations (1633-1673)-1673](jesuit_relations_1633-1673.md) must have been to Europeans
	- had to admit that Wendat system of justice was effective, even though they didn't kill murderers and thieves
		- compensation payments from clan or lineage; that way everyone has to keep kin under control
		- the whole country might assemble to agree on the compensation due to "stay vengeance"

- things to note (that i didn't mention above)
	- some people were clearly wealth
		- Wendat society not "economically egalitarian"; but this was wealth like wampum and other "political" treasures, rather than economic resources, like land, which was owned by families and collectives
		- Wendat men hoarded these in order to be able to give them away

#theme turn access to material resources into power (power to allow one to make others work for you, or compel them to do anything they did not wish to do)^[p 43]

Wendat didn't have way to do that with land/agricultural products, or wampus-style objects

- at best (worst) riches (accumulation AND distribution) might make likely to run for political office
	- but merely holding office didn't give you right to give anyone orders and have them obeyed

#subchapter *in which we show how Europeans learned from (native) Americans about the connection between reasoned debate, personal freedoms and the refusal of arbitrary power* ^[pp 44-48]

## 6. defining equality in two senses

- so the French and Americans were actually arguing about "freedom" not "equality"
- let's look at how the rare instances of equality WERE talked about
	- […]
- notions of equality
	- Eurasian notion: equality before the law; equality before the sovereign; equality in common subjugation
	- American notion: equal insofar as they were free to obey or disobey orders as they saw fit
		- if no compulsion is allowed, then "such social coherence as did exist" had to be intentionally created (debate, arguments, social consensus)

## 7. why the Enlightenment is associated with a certain talking style

- why were Americans so good at debating (p 45) (or … persuading)
	- Jesuits saw intrinsic relations between "refusal of arbitrary powers" and "open political debate"
- persuading: (oh, G&W mean rhetorical techniques)
	- doesn't have to be logical argumentation
	- appeal to sentiment
	- whipping up passions
	- poetic metaphors
	- myth
	- common wisdom
	- irony and indirection
	- humor
	- insult
	- appeals to prophecy or revelation
- the Wendat preferred the "reasoned debate" tactic (rational, sceptical, empirical, conversational in tone)
	- this is the kind of debate associated with the [Enlightenment](age_of_enlightenment.md)
	- so Jesuits and Enlightenment thinkers and revolutionaries saw this to be innately connected with "rejection of arbitrary authority" (esp of the clergy)

- 1650
	- French missionaries try to evangelize "New France" (Nova Scotia and Quebec )
	- European thinkers got egalitarian State of Nature concept
	- terms "(in)equality" just starting to get used commonly in intellectual circles
	- reading public interested in "primordial societies"
- not until "dialogic encounter":
	- see people in State of Nature as "noble" (in sense of being like nobles, hunting and aristocrats, and then later the newer sense)
	- see people as rational sceptics and "champions of individual liberty"

- talking about "equality"
	- New France colonists, nor indigenous Americans, didn't use "equality"
- rather, talked about "liberty" and "mutual aid", aka "freedom" and "communism"

- term: communism
	- since early 1800s, debates about existence of something called "primitive communism"
		- brought up [[Northeast Woodlands]] societies
			- (ever since [Friedrich Engels](friedrich_engels.md) used the Iroquois as a prime example of primitive communism in his [The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (1884)](origin_of_the_family_private_property_and_the_state_1884.md)
	- in this period, (property regime definition) communism means communal ownership, esp of productive resources
		- as applied to America
			- many American societies "ambiguous" as regards communism as communal ownership
				- women owned and worked fields individually
				- stored and disposed of products collectively
				- men owned tools and weapons individually
				- shared out game and spoils
	- another meaning:
		- not as property regime
		- "original sense" communism: from each / to each
	- another: [baseline communism](baseline_communism.md)
		- how far baseline communism extends is uh … what varies (in … ?)

class between very different concepts of **individualism**

- baseline communism very restricted in 17th century French
	- squabbling
- [Northeast Woodlands](Northeast%20Woodlands), and many societies, inconceivable to refuse a request for food
	- guaranteed means to autonomous life
	- or ensure no one subordinated to another
	- communism **in support of** individual freedom
- [[Great Lakes region]]
	- similar

*only over time* did "no one's will subordinated to another" become talking about "equality"

#subchapter *in which we introduce the Wendat philosopher-statesman Kandiaronk, and explain how his views on human nature and society took on new life in the salons of enlightenment Europe (including an aside on the concept of ‘schismogenesis’)* ^[pp 48-59]

## 8. proto-Enlightenment salons with Kandiaronk (aka yeah Lahontan's accounts were really quoting Kandiaronk)

- story of [Lahontan](Lahontan.md) and [Kandiaronk](Kandiaronk.md)
	- [Curious Dialogues with the Savage of Great Wisdom Who Has Traveled](Curious_dialogues_with_a_savage_of_great_wisdom_and_sense_who_has_traveled.md)
		- critical opinions of European mores
			- ideas about religion
			- politics
			- health
			- sexual life
	- pretty clear that these were actually statements and beliefs of Kandiaronk/Adario, and not just Lahontan with another agenda, like getting criticisms past Church censorship
		- [[Barbara Alice Mann]]: "excellent reason for accepting them as genuine"
- [[Count de Frontenac]] proto-Enlightenment salon, Kandiaronk as rational sceptic

### 8.1. new move: "organization of private property" enters into things[^11] = theme (translate wealth into power) || also, equality finally articulated?
- came from Americans observing French society up close

#theme Whereas in their own societies there was no obvious way to convert wealth into power over others (with the consequence that differences of wealth had little effect on individual freedom), in France the situation could not have been more different. Power over possessions could be directly translated into power over other human beings.[^12]

[The Dialogues](Curious_dialogues_with_a_savage_of_great_wisdom_and_sense_who_has_traveled.md)
- the term "equality" is "invoked as a self-conscious ideal" only after a great deal of dialogic confrontation (perhaps at least the six years Kandiaronk has been studying Europe)

just because Kandiaronk and his assertions are exaggerated, don't mean he's a projection of fantasy[^13]



#subchapter *in which we explain the demiurgic powers of a. r. j. turgot, and how he turned the indigenous critique of european civilization on its head, laying the basis for most modern views of social evolution (or: how an argument about ‘freedom’ became one about ‘equality’)* ^[pp 59-62]

#subchapter how jean-jacques rousseau, having won one prestigious essay competition, then lost another (coming in over the permitted word length), but finally went on to conquer the whole of human history ^[pp 63-67]

#subchapter *in which we consider relationships between the indigenous critique, the myth of progress and the birth of the left* ^[pp 67-71]

#subchapter *beyond the ‘myth of the stupid savage’ (why all these things matter so much for our project in this book)* ^[pp 71-77]

this is from, like, the beginning of chapter 3:

## 9. “WHY EVEN VERY SOPHISTICATED RESEARCHERS STILL FIND WAYS TO CLING TO THE IDEA THAT SOCIAL INEQUALITY HAS AN ‘ORIGIN”

- points DoE is arguing against:
	- hunter-gatherers lived in a state of primordial innocence[^2]

terms

- **Upper Paleolithic period**: Archaeology. Roughly 50,000 to 15,000 BC, characterized by "princely" burials and grand communal buildings

history of ideas

- **Evolutionary Psychology**
	- "dominance behavior is hardwired in our genes, so much so that “the moment society goes beyond tiny bands, it must necessarily take the form of some ruling over others."[^3]

### 9.1. analysis of Boehm

[[../boehm_christopher]]
- evolutionary anthropologist
- specialist in primare studies
- his arguments:[^4]
	- humans have instinct to engage in dom/sub behavior
		- this instinct is inherited from simian ancestors
		- (despite this instinct) humans are humans because they can choose to not act like that
		- itemizes tactics to humble any pretenders to dominance
			- these tactics don't have parallels with any primate (other than humans) behavior
			- his sources are ethnographic accounts of existing egalitarian foraging bands
				- eg. humans mock people for "chest-beating"
			- bullying is / may be instinctual, but "counter-bullying" is not
				- **[[../actuarial_intelligence]]**[^5]
					- similar to Aristotle's definition of humans as "political animals" - it's precisely what primates can't do[^6]

### 9.2. considering the implications of Boehm

Boehm's point:

- essence of humanity is being self-conscious political actors
	- corollary: humans can embrace wide range of social arrangements
	- implication: humans explored a wide range of social arrangements over history[^7]

Boehm's conclusions:

- all humans until recently chose to follow same arrangements, that being "strictly egalitarian"
	- only with agriculture did humans follow hierarchy
- "social equality" and "social inequality" did not exist as concepts
	- [evidence]: recent survey of medieval literature finds no evidence of aequalitas or inaequalitas or cognates used to describe social relations before Columbus [^1]
- equality/inequality terms only "enter common currency" in early 17th century (1600s) after [natural law theory](natural_law_theory.md), which arose during debates about moral and legal implications of Europe's New World discoveries

[^8]: [Pinker](steven_pinker.md) is also guilty of this as pointed out in [Dawn of Everything: Ch 1: Farewell to Humanity’s Childhood (notes)](dawn_of_everything_ch_1_farewell_to_humanitys_childhoodnotes.md)
[^inequalityterm]: - "the problem of" "the origin of social inequality" was not a problem that would have made sense to people in the [[Middle_Ages]]^[p 32]
	- ranks and hierarchies existed since "the very beginning"
	- even in Eden, Adam outranked Eve
[^9]: > People who tried to grab the stage, denying others the means to present their arguments, were acting in much the same way as those who grabbed the material means of subsistence and refused to share it; it is hard to avoid the impression that Americans saw the French as existing in a kind of Hobbesian state of ‘war of all against all’.
