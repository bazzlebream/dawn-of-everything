# Dawn of Everything: Ch 2: Wicked Liberty (notes)

*The indigenous critique and the myth of progress*

## 2.1. intro

## 2.2. IN WHICH WE SHOW HOW CRITIQUES OF EUROCENTRISM CAN BACKFIRE, AND END UP TURNING ABORIGINAL THINKERS INTO 'SOCK-PUPPETS'

[ • • •]

### 2.2.1. section break

- "the problem of" "the origin of social inequality" was not a problem that would have made sense to people in the [[Middle Ages]]
	- ranks and hierarchies existed since "the very beginning"
	- even in Eden, Adam outranked Eve
- "social equality" and "social inequality" did not exist as concepts
	- [evidence]: recent survey of medieval literature finds no evidence of aequalitas or inaequalitas or cognates used to describe social relations before Columbus [^1]
- equality/inequality terms only "enter common currency" in early 17th century (1600s) after [[natural law theory]], which arose during debates about moral and legal implications of Europe's New World discoveries

## 2.3. “WHY EVEN VERY SOPHISTICATED RESEARCHERS STILL FIND WAYS TO CLING TO THE IDEA THAT SOCIAL INEQUALITY HAS AN ‘ORIGIN”

- points DoE is arguing against:
	- hunter-gatherers lived in a state of primordial innocence[^2]

terms

- **Upper Paleolithic period**: Archaeology. Roughly 50,000 to 15,000 BC, characterized by "princely" burials and grand communal buildings

history of ideas

- **Evolutionary Psychology**
	- "dominance behavior is hardwired in our genes, so much so that “the moment society goes beyond tiny bands, it must necessarily take the form of some ruling over others."[^3]

### 2.3.1. analysis of Boehm

[[../boehm_christopher]]
- evolutionary anthropologist
- specialist in primare studies
- his arguments:[^4]
	- humans have instinct to engage in dom/sub behavior
		- this instinct is inherited from simian ancestors
		- (despite this instinct) humans are humans because they can choose to not act like that
		- itemizes tactics to humble any pretenders to dominance
			- these tactics don't have parallels with any primate (other than humans) behavior
			- his sources are ethnographic accounts of existing egalitarian foraging bands
				- eg. humans mock people for "chest-beating"
			- bullying is / may be instinctual, but "counter-bullying" is not
				- **[[../actuarial_intelligence]]**[^5]
					- similar to Aristotle's definition of humans as "political animals" - it's precisely what primates can't do[^6]

### 2.3.2. considering the implications of Boehm

Boehm's point:

- essence of humanity is being self-conscious political actors
	- corollary: humans can embrace wide range of social arrangements
	- implication: humans explored a wide range of social arrangements over history[^7]

Boehm's conclusions:

- all humans until recently chose to follow same arrangements, that being "strictly egalitarian"
	- only with agriculture did humans follow hierarchy
