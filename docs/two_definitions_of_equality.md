# two definitions of equality

- so the French and Americans were actually arguing about "freedom" not "equality"
- let's look at how the rare instances of equality WERE talked about (ie. late in the historical game, when "self-conscious ideas of ‘equality’, putting equality forward as an explicit value (as opposed to an ideology of freedom, or dignity, or participation that applies equally to all) appear to have been relative latecomers to human history." )[^1]
	- […]
- notions of equality
	- Eurasian notion: **equality before the law**; equality before the sovereign; equality in common subjugation
	- American notion: equal insofar as they were free to obey or disobey orders as they saw fit
		- if no compulsion is allowed, then "such social coherence as did exist" had to be intentionally created (debate, arguments, social consensus)
		- liberty / autonomy ?
