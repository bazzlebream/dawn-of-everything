# Dawn of Everything: Ch 8: Imaginary Cities (notes) pp 276-327

[dawn_of_everything_ch_8_attempted_summary](dawn_of_everything_ch_8_attempted_summary.md)

## § (chapter intro) (276-278)

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^ab73bd) --> 

### ¶ (intro) (276)

- [Canetti's theory of invisible crowds](canetti_theory_invisible_crowds.md) is related to the idea that very large social units are always imaginary, in a certain sense
- what does this mean?
	- you relate to friends, places you know directly, in a fundamentally distinct way from things like empires and metropolises, which exist largely "in our heads"
	- mass society exists in the mind before, and after, it becomes physical reality

#aside much of social theory "can be seen" as an attempt to square these two "dimensions" of our experience
- see (	- [Claude Fischer](fischer_claude.md): “urbanites live in small social worlds that touch but do not interpenetrate.”) below ?

### ¶ section break (276-278)

- this is not the case:
	- [[theory of scaffolding]]: humans evolved in small groups, and anything large is unnatural, so we need "scaffolding" like police and social workers to make larger communities work
		- if true, this would mean that large collections of people would lead to the rise of states (writing, administrators, storage, overseers, social classes -- "civilization", in other words)
		- evidence does not support this
			- some cities governed selves for centuries without temples and palaces
			- some cities, no evidence of class admins or ruling stratum
			- some, centralized power appears and disappears
		- that is, [[civilization does not come as a package]]
		- that is, urban life does not necessarily imply a particular form of political organization

## § in which we first take on the notorious issue of 'scale' (278-284)

### ¶ (intro) (278-281)

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^905526)  -->

- [[the problem of scale]]: a fake problem where it's thought that small groups are democratic and large groups that's difficult
	- clearly false, look at your family
	- how did this get articulated / emerge
		- [[Robin Dunbar]]: [[tier-model of scale]]
	- objection: many humans don't like their families very much
		- indeed, residential groups aren't made of biological kin at all, with evidence at least back to the [[Pleistocene]]
			- "Anyone recognized to be Martu is a potential member of any Martu band"
		- kinship in such cases in a metaphor for social attachments
		- shared metaphor extended over very long distances
	- as though: modern foragers exist at two radically distances scales: small and intimate, && vast territories
		- odd? not from cognitive science: this capacity (to shift between scales) separates human social cognition from other primates
			- [dig on chimps] "nothing is imagined as eternal" (with non-human primates); "nothing is really imagined at all"

- imaginary structures
	- live inside them
	- bound to people we will never meet
	- take part in macro-society that's "virtual reality"
	- possible relationships
	- own rules, roles, structures
	- held in mind
	- recalled through image-making and ritual

terminology:

- foragers live in small **groups**, but not in small-scale **societies**

that said, scale (population size) does matter, just not the way we think

### ¶ section break (281-283)

this is just adding proof that humans can think in imaginary totalities?

- in "human terms", cities are not stable (that is, the people in them)
- cities have a "life" that transcends this
	- not because of bricks or whatever
	- because people think and act as "people who belong to the city"
	- [Claude Fischer](fischer_claude.md): “urbanites live in small social worlds that touch but do not interpenetrate.”

- cities are like vast territories
	- structures raised primarily in the human imagination
	- possibility for amicable relations with strangers
	- so, probably not any cognitive challenges when vast regional systems were "squeezed" into single urban space, while still being virtual

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^573c2e) -->

- so what's new?
	- first settlements of 10,000+ appeared around 6kya, on almost every continent, in isolation
	- then they multiply
	- they are all so different
	- in fact, they are all so different from one another, that they almost must be self-conscious experiments with city form
	- surprisingly few had authoritarian rule
	- diverse ecologies
		- don't rely on rural hinterlands that provide grain for urban dwellers
		- small-scale gardening and animal-keeping important
		- rivers and seas important
		- hunting and collecting of file seasonal foods in forests or marshes

### ¶ section break (283-284)

for african material[^1]

- will focus on eurasia and mesoamerica

- what were early cities like to live in?
- why did cities appear in the first place?
	- (spoiler: is it not because seasonal aggregation sites became permanent)

## § in which we set the scene broadly for a world of cities, and speculate as to why they first arose (284-288)

### ¶ (all) (284-288)

[[early urban world]]
- grand self-conscious statements of civic unity
- built spaces in harmonious, beautiful patterns
- municipal-scale planning
- citizens call selves "the people" or the "sons and daughters" of a given city
	- united by devotion to founders, gods, heroes, civic infrastructure, ritual calendar (and festivities)
- people living in them often came from far away
	- migrants settle in own neighborhoods
- usually divided into quarters, with enduring rivalries
	- consolidated neighborhoods marked by walls, gates, ditches
- what's strange?
	- absence of certain technologies (advanced metallurgy, intensive agriculture, administrative records, the wheel)
- largest early cities (by population) appeared in Mesoamerica, not Eurasia

civic festivals: moments when imaginary structures temporarily became tangible and material

- return to question:

####  why did so many end up living in same space?

##### definitely wrong answer

- (conventional answer): technological factors, cities result of Agricultural Revolution, possibility to support large populations, required states to administer
	- or, seasonal that settled down

##### better answer

- [[Teotihuacan]]: peaks at 100k people, due to volcanic eruptions which drove populations to settle there
- pattern? **environmental changes due to secondary, post-Ice Age ecological shuffling**
	- change: rivers
		- beginning of [[Holocene]], rivers wild and unpredictable
		- 7kya, **flood regimes changed,** lead to settled routines
		- creation of wide, **fertile floodplains** (yellow river, indus, tigris)
	- change: **stable sea levels**
		- melting of polar glaciers slowed (Middle Holocene), so stabler sea levels
	- two together:
		- creation of "great fan-like deltas"
		- **deltaic environments attract human populations**
			- neolithic farmers, crops, livestock (now with access to open sea, expansive marshlands, organic materials for construction)
			- (possible that **extensive agriculture was outcome**, not cause, of urbanization)
			- peasantries were later development

some examples:

- China's Shandong province on Yellow River
	- 2500 bc, 300 hectares or larger
- Peru's RioSupe
	- 4000 years older than Inca Empire
- Maya lowlands
	- ceremonial centers, with no evidence of stratification or monarchy, dated to 1000 bc

for sure:

- **those cities much older than systems of authoritarian government and literate admin (once) assumed necessary to their foundation**

question:

**- what held earliest experiments in urbanization together (like, per city) - what was the "social glue"**

## § on 'mega-sites’, and how archaeological findings in Ukraine are overturning conventional wisdom on the origins of cities (288-297)

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^3e290b) -->

### ¶ (intro) (contains map) [ 288-294 )

#aside: why do we assume that people who figured out how to live without horrendous things were less complex than those who haven't

#### Megasites should be called cities

- Black Sea (prehistory)
	- a bunch of lavish tombs
- however, what's more interesting are cities in Ukraine and Moldova
	- Yaljanky, Maidenetske, Nevelivka (early to middle 4th millenium BC)
		- before and larger (in area) than earliest Mesopotamian cities
	- called "mega-sites" which (wrong) implies they shouldn't be thought of as cities
		- why are they called this, or "overgrown villages"?
			- political: initial discovery by Eastern Bloc scholars (etc)
			- internal political life of settlements: there wasn't any, according to "conventional view of politics"
				- so was "simple" not "complex" society (in evolutionist terms)
	- Ukraine sites inhabited 4100-3300 bc (8 centuries)
		- born of ecological opportunism?
			- not floodplain dynamics, but processes of soil formation on flatlands north of Black Sea
				- [[chernozem]] soil
		- (pre-existing) cohesive social identify of the Neolithic people who came east
			- [[Cucuteni-Tripolyte culture]]: similar cultural practices, dwelling forms, female figurines, ways of making and serving food
		- so, mega-sites physical realization of extended community (make of settlements that coalesced)
			- and nothing that stands out, just 1000+ houses, arranged concentrically, with nothing in the middle
			- close together (6-9 miles) with populations of 1000s each, up to 10,000, but very light ecological footprint
			- probably in between permanently inhabited and strictly seasonal

<!-- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Bnwy3Uh.png) -->

- inhabitants of mega-sites were "eco-conscious" as we'd say, and avoided large-scale deforestation
	- instead they did small-scale gardening, livestock, orchards, hunting and foraging
	- diverse and sustainable

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^938335) -->

> “As well as wheat, barley and pulses, the citizens’ plant diet included apples, pears, cherries, sloes, acorns, hazelnuts and apricots. Mega-site dwellers were hunters of red deer, roe deer and wild boar as well as farmers and foresters. It was 'play farming’ on a grand scale: an urban populus[^2] supporting itself through small-scale cultivation and herding, combined with an extraordinary array of wild foods”[^3]

- not simple, but complex
	- manage orchards, gardens, livestock, woodlands
	- importation of salt in bulk
	- extract flint "by the ton"
	- household potting industry
	- import copper from Balkans
- definitely produced a surplus, yet little evidence for warfare or social elites over 800 years
- complexity: strategies they adopted to prevent that (warfare, elites)

- **another example that egalitarianism does not mean "simple"**

### ¶ section break ( 294-297 ]

**how did they make collective decisions?**
- related to (below) how to explain certain uniformities (implied: if there's no centralization)
	- [zw] aren't G&W assuming that uniformity proceeds from something, rather than dis-uniformity needing to be explained?

> “some of them, such as Maidenetske and Nebelivka, mobilized their populations to dig perimeter ditches, marking out a garden space between the outer circuit of houses and the edge of the settlement. ”

- we can't really know, but there are clues
- houses were based on a common plan, but also entirely unique
- women
	- pottery evokes bodies of women
	- female figurines of clay
	- model houses affirm prominent role of women
	- see [[marija_gimbutas]]

but how did they come together to form the concentric arrangements

- (as before in reference to houses) constant deviation from norm, despite apparent uniformity
	- way houses clustered (three to ten families)
		- boundaries marked with ditches
	- sometimes the groups become neighborhoods (wedge-shaped)
	- sometimes so large as to form districts or "quarters"
	- each (neighborhood) access to:
		- relatively large assembly house for gathering ([John Chapman](John%20Chapman) notes they don't have food-prep areas or tools)
- [zw exim] it's really the uniformity we need to explain, not the deviation
	- rose from bottom up, through "local decision-making"
	- strongly implies: house members or representatives shared conceptual framework
		- framework (in this case) based on circle (or disc) and "its properties of transformation"[^4]
	- ok, but how did they realize[^5]  this mental image, and at scale
		- look to [[ethno-mathematics]]
			- ethno-mathematics has looked at [[Basque settlements in Pyrénées-Atlantiques highlands]] ==>

[[Basque]]
- imagine communities in circular form
	- and surrounded by circle of mountains
	- ideal equality of households
- self-conscious egalitarian projects
- [[Sainte-Engrâce]]
	- circular template is dynamic model used as counting device
		- marks rotation of tasks and duties
- as we see: entire cosmology, a theory of the human condition, baked in
	- loaves are "semen"
	- care for dead and dying goes in opposite direction as bread
- also economic cooperation
	- system of substitution for households unable to do duty
	- model for all forms of cooperation
- you can't schedule what you want without organizing with a whole bunch of other people (obligations to others, ad infinitum)
	- gets extremely complex

- **another example that egalitarianism does not mean "simple"**

the reality of perceived simplicity

- involve complex logistical challenges
- intricate system of mutual aid
- no central control
	- [zw: exim]: indeed it's precisely this absence of centralization that requires the complexity (because otherwise they could just use violence to impose a single simple idea)
- "simple" societies are not simple
	- Basque don't even use communal assemblies, they use math!
		- end result is same
		- and almost complete absence of internal conflict
	- no reason to assume it would only work on small scale
		- already violates [Dunbar's threshold](dunbars_number.md)
		- easy to see how they would scale up

transition: let's look at Mesopotamia

## § on Mesopotamia, and 'not-so-primitive’ democracy ( 297-304 )

### ¶ (intro) [ 297-298 )

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^23a89e) -->

- history of cities back to 4000 bc (6kya)
- archaeological surprises for those who knew these areas through the bible
	- [[Hammurabi law code]] stela
	- [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] clay tablets
	- [[Royal Tombs of Ur]]
	- entire [[Sumerian]] culture, to which the Royal Tombs belonged
- but, still the confirmation of association of ancient Mesopotamia with empire and monarchy, (late 19th to early 20th century work ), even Sumerian period
- fortunately, modern archaeology rewrites this picture; Mesopotamia never an eternal land of kings

### ¶ section break ( 298-304 ]

```
trying to answer: “what was the nature of government in Mesopotamian cities before the appearance of kingship?’ ” ? p 304

```

- earliest Mesopotamian cities (3300 bc) - no clear evidence for monarchy
	- can't prove a negative?
	- well, we know what the evidence *would* look like, because 2800 bc onward, monarchy is everywhere [[Early Dynastic period]]
		- signs: palaces, aristocratic burials, royal inscriptions, defensive walls, organized mililtia

[[primitive democracy]], according to modern scholars:

#### so-called "primitive democracy": a description of the state of affairs

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^41db1d) -->

- basic elements of Mesopotamian civic life and urban society began before the [Early Dynastic period](Early%20Dynastic)]
	- (some of these were wrongly characterized as "inventions of royal statecraft", ie attributed to monarchies)
	- elements:
		- labor mobilization / [[early mesopotamian corvee]] (attributed to monarchy, but actually already very ancient, as the gods created people for this according to [[Atrahasis flood myth]]), where all contributed
			- yes, royal hymns are part propaganda, but people look happy (or at least festive and carnivalesque)  and probably did it despite the royals taking credit for the "why"
				- moral order of city "spun on its axis"
				- distinctions dissolved away
				- [[Hymns of Gudea]] for example of atmosphere
			- debt cancellation
			- (so, labor mobilization = absolute equality before gods)
			**- (and, [imaginary city](imaginary_communities.md) became real - individual identities "shed" as they become "the people" of a certain city)**
- (if so, hard to write festivals off as pure symbolic display)
- other institutions, too, ensure citizens had hand in government
	- town councils, wards, assemblies (and with women!) to which rulers of city-states answerable
		- not as powerful as in ancient greece (but also slavery and anti-woman not as powerful)
	- corporate bodies might also rise up successfully
- not "primitive": institutions weren't crude or unsophisticated

#### why modern scholars call this "primitive democracy" • 301

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^3921c2) -->

- looking at "[[the idea Mesopotamia possessed a primitive democracy]]"
	- first proposed by [[Thorkild Jacobsen]] in 1940s, and since extended
	- however, his "district councils and assemblies of elders" exist in tons of places, right down to the [Early Dynastic](Early%20Dynastic.md) period (zw: not just in the early, primitive times of history)[^6]
	- however, we don't know how they actually functioned

- wards were active in administration
- participatory government in multiple levels
	- unfortunately written evidence **doesn't tell us how the system worked**
		- historians say that's because the **assemblies operated independently of central government**
		- archaeologists agree, mostly
			- [Mashkan-shapir](Mashkan-shapir)
				- sanctuary of [[Nergal - god of the underworld]]
				- strikingly even distribution of wealth despite main temple
				- no obvious centers of commercial or political power
			- [[Amorite Dynasty of the Lims]]
				- arrival of these authoritarians precipitated mass exodus from [[Mari]]
			- [[letters from Terru to Zimri-Lim]] (A lieutenant governor to emperor, basically) are like: yo, these people hate me because I'm associated with you)
- so, urbanites didn't need rules; in fact, they were autonomous self-governing units which could drive out rulers or abandon the city
- still doesn't answer our main question here: **“what was the nature of government in Mesopotamian cities *before* the appearance of kingship?’** ” (see above)

## § in which we describe how (written) history, and probably (oral) epic too, began: with big councils in the cities, and small kingdoms in the hills (305-313)

### ¶ (intro) (305-306)

[zw sum]: we definitely know what royal rule looks like, and then probably non-royal-rule too, in Uruk

#### Uruk

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^0268d6) -->

- 3300 bc
- cuneiform script may have been invented here
- by late 4th millennium bc:
	- had high acropolis taken up by "raised public district" [[Eanna]]
		- 9 huge buildings
		- bits of stairwells
		- fragments of big hallways
		- roofs (probably) of exotic timber
- we know nothing of the residential districts beyond [[Eanna]]
	- public buildings were communal halls modeled on ordinary household plans; constructed as "houses of the gods"
	- [[Great Court]] - trees and gardens
	- ie magnificent temples with big nice space for public meetings
		- (what one would expect if popular assemblies) - as Gilgamesh mentions
		- similar to [[Pnyx]] in Athens, but larger, and since Uruk had smaller population, there must have been more (in proportion) participation
- later, things change:
	- 3200 bc
		- public buildings razed, covered
		- sacred landscape designed around gated courts and ziggurats
	- 2900 bc
		- local kings battling it out
		- 5.5 mile fortification wall
	- c 2700 bc
		- city rulers as neighbors of gods
			- houses next to Eanna
			- stamping names on Eanna bricks
- (later evidence for royal rule is clear, (so we can probably guess where non-royal rule))

### ¶ section break ( 306-313 ]

- Uruk writing: readable, but difficult to interpret
	- cuneiform tablets from dumps
		- mostly bureaucratic receipts
		- school texts
			- points to "college of scribes administering complicated relations between people, animals and things" and more going on in houses of gods than just ritual gatherings
				- administer goods and industries
				- pedagogical techniques that are still with us (classroom, rows, curriculum)
- now on to [[houses of the gods]] ?
	- factories more than churches
	- lots of human labor at disposal
	- workshops
	- stockpiles of raw materials
	- (organization of quantification of human labor into standard workloads and units of time are still with us)
	- base-60 (from which our system of time-reckoning)[^7]
- who were the temple laborers?
	- permanently attached, or citizens doing corvee?
	- children means some lived there
	- probably had nowhere else to go[^8]
	- workforce probably the urban needy
		- (possible that charitable organization transformed as captives and slaves added to mix)
- remarkable number of industries
	- dairy production
	- wool production
	- leavened bread
	- beer & wine
	- standardized packaging
	- 80 varieties of fish Fish80 (fresh and salt)
		- oil and food products
	- these products traded for wood, metal, precious stone (only available in high country)[^9]
- economic functions of temple "sector"
	- coordinate labor at key times of year
	- provide quality control for processed goods *that differed from those made in ordinary households*[^10]
	- [[principle of standardization]]
	- (administrative control/top-down bureaucracy for economic/commodities)
	- to supply gods and goddesses with residences, offerings, festivals
		- [Uruk Vase](Uruk_Vase.md)
		- #aside  [[Uruk Man]]  is not a king ([[lugal]])
			- aka monarchy did not have a role yet
- (today's "State sector" (public works, IR) by local or city-wide assemblies)
- of course, no explicit idea of "economy" at the time

#### Uruk Expansion

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^fc5536) -->

[main page](Uruk%20Expansion.md)

- #term [[Uruk Expansion]] (term in archae) / colonial process
- (don't know how trade organized yet)
- but there was trade, for wood, metal, gems with high country
- **Uruk colonies** (as commercial outposts and religious centers) established along those trade routes
- effort to transform lives of nearby people (disseminate new habits)
- very zealous efforts, but no real violence, weapons, fortifications
- introduce [[principle of standardization]] rather than the novel goods themselves

#### counter-reaction to Uruk Expansion (309-313]

"origin for ‘heroic societies’ of this sort, it is to be found precisely on the spatial and cultural margins of the world’s first great urban expansion"[^11]

##### Arslantepe

- [[Arslantepe]]
	- maybe started as seasonal trade fair, 3300 ft above sea level
	- small, never larger than five hectares[^12]
	- remarkable political developments
		- 3000 bc - temple like Uruk temples (admin)
		- temple dismantled within few hundred? years
		- in its place, built audience chamber, living quarters, storage, armory, swords[^13] and spears (nothing like lowlands)
		- "aesthetics of personal combat and killing"

##### Rise of warrior aristocracy

- 3100 bc, evidence of more of this (warrior aristocracy stuff)
	- armed, living in hill forts or palaces ([Beowulfian](beowulf.md) mead halls , PNC[^14] in 19th cent, Maori of New Zealand)
	- tombs of heroes
	- **no bureaucracy**
	- spirit of extravagance
	- lots of good food, mead, jewelry
	- funerals were competitive, and they just burned unique items
		- and also other people they murdered at the funeral
		- not isolated like Ice Age ones: whole cemeteries full
			- eg [Başur Höyük](basur_hoyuk.md)
- beginning of aristocratic ethos
	- lasts for a long time in Eurasia, and has broad effects
	- "We are witnessing the first known emergence of what [[Hector Munro Chadwick]] famously called '[heroic societies](theory_of_heroic_societies.md)’ and, moreover, these societies all seem to have emerged just where his analysis tells us to expect them: on the margins of bureaucratically ordered cities."[^15]
	- aristocracies
	- no centralized authority or principle of sovereignty ("or, maybe, some largely symbolic, formal ones")
	- no single center: numerous people competing for "retainers and slaves"
	- "politics" =
		- history of debts of loyalty or vengeance
		- game-like contests
		- pomp to dispose of huge quantities of wealth
		- resist writing (employ poets or priests and oral composition)
		- reject commerce (within own societies)
		- eschew standardized currency & embrace "unique material treasures"

## § in which we consider whether the Indus civilization was an example of caste before kingship (313-321)

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^75f0cb) -->

### ¶ (all) (313-321)

#### Indus

##### Mohenjo-Daro

- 2600 bc
- [Mohenjo Daro](mohenjo_daro.md) founded
	- persisted for 700 years
	- original example of the "Indus" or "[Harappan](Harappa.md)" civilization
	- large-scale, planned human settlements emerge without ruling classes and elites
	- also, **cool/puzzling features**: (this will end up being the pre-caste purity vs commerce stuff)
		- big palaces in the Lower Town
- brick-built houses of Lower Town
- above: Upper Citadel ([Mound of the Great Bath](great_bath.md)), raised civic center
	- encased in wall of baked bricks

##### Harappa

- as large as Mohenjo-Daro
- on [[Ravi River]]

##### others

- colonial outposts
	- [[Shortugai]]
- [[Dholavira]]
- [[Lothal]]
	- port town to service maritime trade

#### Indus civilization

- own script[^16]
- amulets
- archaeological idea of it is a "false composite" of 500 years of change due to the fast, but imprecise, techniques used at the time
- size: don't know
- population: don't know (maybe 40k)
- boundaries: not sure (100 hectares? 300 hectares?)

##### civic life in the first cities of South Asia

**insights into "is there a causal relationship between scale and inequality in human societies?"**[^17]
- (turns out, the inequality is in levels of "purity" (pre-caste) so there's no sense in applying traditional (ie neoliberal economic) metrics to it  )
	- (i'm not sure how this answers the "is there" part)
- wealth distribution at [Mohenjo-daro](mohenjo_daro.md)
	- no concentration on [[Upper Citadel]]
	- metals, gemstones, worked shell widely available to [[Lower Town]] households
		- also terracotta figures
- writing, standard weights and measures widely distributed across Lower Town
- craft occupations, industries (metalworking, potting, bead making) too
- all this absent from Upper Citadel and its main civic structures
	- (no objects for personal display)
	- but there are: [Great Bath](great_bath.md)
- #aside faceless civilization (Indus lacks royal sculpture and monumental depictions)
	- (what they end up saying is that this is example of hierarchies in some areas (purity vs merchandry) and egalitarian in others (local government) )
	- (in other words, there weren't charismatic or violent leaders)
	- (seeds for caste system)
- yes, Mohenjo-daro (um, what are we talking about here?)
	- focus of civic life was public facility for purifying the body.
		- (specific notions of cleanliness)
- so, Great Bath "an outsized version of residential washing facilities"
	- but in some cases, Upper Citadel life negates that of Lower Town
		- no industrial activities nearby (architecture prevented ox-drawn carts)
		- Bath itself was focus of life and labor
		- barracks and storerooms housed staff and essential supplies
			- so, Upper Citadel reversed ordinary principles of household organization
- #aside caste system[^18]
	- similar
		- hierarchical division of social functions
		- ascending scale of purity
	- but
		- caste not mentioned in South Asia until 1000 years later in [[Rig Veda]]
			- [varna system](Rig%20Veda.md#varna%20system): highest value is purity of priestly caste
			- you can't apply [[Gini coefficients]] or property-based measures of inequality to this, because the inequality is based on purity
- caste system helps make sense of Mohenjo-daro's "puzzling features"
	- puzzling feature: residential buildings that look like palaces are not located on Upper Citadel but crammed into Lower Town streets (where jostling for worldly status belonged)
- (obviously we can't just project 1000 year later social world onto Indus civilization)
	- **if we could, though**, (we could reference the "[[faceless civilization]]" observation) a major difference would be that varna system has [[kshatriya]] warrior caste as #2, below brahmins; but Bronze-age indus, there's nothing like that, nor the aggrandizing behavior associated with those groups in epic tales
		- even in largest cities, no evidence of spectacular sacrifices or feast; or murals of military prowess, celebrations of deeds, tournaments, aristocratic burials
- (it was a caste system without "charismatic authority figures") so, Indus civilization wasn't arcadia, and it wasn't completely peaceful
	- #aside (briefly treat of [[priest-king]] figurine), which there are no evidence for, to prove there indeed weren't  "charismatic authority figures"[^19]

####

**so, if there's no priest-kings, warrior nobility, or other state-y things, can we say it's an egalitarian city?**

- well, there was a clear hierarchy **between groups** (ascetic order of Upper Citadel, and wealthy merchants around that, and Lower Town)
- but that doesn't mean there was hierarchy **within groups** (in internal organization)
- also doesn't mean the ascetics (pure) and merchants(wealthy) had more say on day-to-day governance

aka, is it even possible for Indus city governance to be egalitarian if there is a hierarchy of social orders

- aka " if the everyday governance of early Indus cities could have proceeded on egalitarian lines, alongside the existence of ascetic social orders"

#### Bali's seka system (319-321]

- well, did something like that happen later?
- yes:
	- social milieu of [[sangha]]
	- The point being: 2kya, ascetic monks had consensus process, governance was based on ideal of equality, and entire cities governed in that way too.

ok, then: are there examples of societies with formal caste hierarchies, where practical governance is egalitarian?

- yes
	- [[seka system]] on Bali
		- Bali ranking (not the seka system) extends to every individual, not just caste
		- seka system is: everyone expected to "participate on equal terms and come to decisions by consensus"
			- eg repairing roofs
			- what food to serve for dance
		- yes, "high" people can refuse to come, but they have to pay fines

we don't know if this was in Indus valley 4kya

- the example just shows that decoupling of social hierarchy from practical mechanics of local governance

not true just of cities, but kingdoms and empires

- usually it's thought kingdoms are in river valleys because agriculture there requires irrigation, and that requires administrative control
- but Bali disproves you need the admin part of that:
- Bali, again
	- divided into intestine kingdoms
	- also small volcanic island with one of densest populations
	- complex system of irrigated wet-rice agriculture
	- kingdoms don't manage the irrigation system at all
		- water-temples
		- water distribution managed by complex system of consensual decision-making by farmers

## § concerning an apparent case of 'urban revolution’ in Chinese prehistory (321-327 ]

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^dbeef6) -->

### ¶ (intro) [ 321 )

#### G&W summarize the preceding

- what happened when cities first appeared (3 places in Eurasia)
	- no monarchs
	- no warrior elite
	- likely institutions of self-governance
	- other than that, pretty different from one another
		- explicit egalitarian ethos: different forms from one another

#### modalities of egalitarian ethos

- "self-conscious ethos of egalitarianism" has two (or, maybe, three, we'll see) modalities (which mix to different degrees in different real-life scenarios) which can be formally separated:
	- everyone is, or should be, precisely the same, in ways we consider important
		- Mesopotamia
	- everyone is so utterly different that there's no criteria for comparison
		- Ukrainian megasites
	- rigorous equality in certain areas, complemented by explicit hierarchy elsewhere
		- Indus valley (a third modality?):

##### table ( modalities of egalitarian ethos )

| where        | difference                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| uruk         | all the same                            |
| mohenjo-daro | no criteria to compare                  |
| indus        | rigorous equality + hierarchy elsewhere |

#### many first cities were egalitarian

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^74aa96) -->
- NOT saying "first cities were egalitarian"
- ARE saying: "archaeological evidence shows that this was a common pattern, and that contradicts conventional evolutionary assumptions about the effects of scale on human society"
	- in all 3 of these places (Ukraine, Uruk, Indus), increase in scale took place, but no corresponding increase in wealth concentration or elite power
	- now, the *burden of proof is on those* who **claim a causal connection between origins of cities and rise of stratified states**

### ¶ section break ( 322-327 ]

<!-- ![](ch8_summary.md#^33b6a3) -->

- we've been showing snapshots
- however, they existed for a while
- they underwent crises
- examples
	- Mohenjo-daro (Ukraine)
		- Great Bath in disrepair 200 years before city's demise
		- industry and normal residences appear on Upper Citadel, and Bath site itself
		- conversely, Lower Town has palatial buildings with craft workshops
		- this existed for hundreds of years
		- self-conscious process of transforming city's hierarchy into  • • • something else (we don't know what)
	- Indus
		- replaced by smaller heroic-aristocrat societies
	- Mesopotamia
		- palaces appear
- yes, this does look like "history going authoritarian"
	- yes, in the long run, it was
	- though, civic institutions and independent cities never go away
- **however, in China, the reverse happened (we went from authoritarian to not authoritarian?)**
	- found cities where (in time and space) there weren't supposed to be any

[ • • •]

#### case of Taosi

[Taosi](Taosi.md)

##### case history

##### case lessons

- (probably) world's first documented social revolution (in an urban setting)
	- early cities: places of self-conscious social experimentation?
	- clashes between different visions (peaceful, or violent)
	- increasing number of people increases range of possibilities, but doesn't predetermine which will be selected

#### transition to chapter 9

- #case central Mexico
	- political urban revolutions very common

    - [G&W] but, we have no idea **how they functioned**; some were probably democratic, oligarchic, monarchic, etc
