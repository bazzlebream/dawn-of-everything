# Canetti's theory of invisible crowds


## invisible crowds
- Paleolithic hunter-gatherers in small communities must have spent time wondering what larger ones would be like
- proof? look at cave walls, where herd animals were in large groups
- they must have wondered about "human herds", and the dead
- these "invisible crowds" were the first cities, even though they were imaginary
