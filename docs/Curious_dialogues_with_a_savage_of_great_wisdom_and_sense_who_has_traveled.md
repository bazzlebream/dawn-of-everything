# Curious dialogues with a savage of great wisdom who has traveled

contributors:
- [Baron Lahontan](Lahontan.md)

- First dialogue:[^1]
	- about religious matters
	- Lahontan allows Adario to "calmly pick apart the logical contradictions and incoherence of Christian doctrines of original sin and redemption" with particular attention to hell
		- cast doubt on historicity of scripture
		- Christians divided into endless sects (all convinced they are completely right and everyone else is bound for hell)
- second chapter?[^2]
	- subject of law
		- European-style punitive law (like eternal damnation) is not necessitated by innate human corruption, but by social organization "encouraging selfish and acquisitive behavior"
		- Kandiaronk says they don't have laws, but since Wendat did have a legal code, he is "clearly" referring to "laws of a coercive or punitive nature"
[...] p 53-56
"equality" as self-conscious ideal comes about only after prolonged conversation
