# Dawn of Everything: Ch 3: Unfreezing the Ice Age (notes)

## 1. terms

- **culture**: complex symbolic human behavior^[p 83]
- **Upper Paleolithic period**: Archaeology. Roughly 50,000 to 15,000 BC, characterized by "princely" burials and grand communal buildings.
- **political (self-)consciousness**: The ability to argue and reflect about the proper way to live.^[p 93] Also see "visionary politics"
- **sapient paradox**: why do so many tens of thousands of years stand between the biological origins of humanity and the widespread appearance of typically human forms of behavior; between when we became capable of creating culture and when we finally got round to doing it? What were we actually doing in the interim?

## 2. Unfreezing the Ice Age: intro

- we don't want to speculate about periods of time during "prehistory" (last 3 million years) for which we have little to no archaeological evidence, because that speculation is likely to just perpetuate myths

# when you don't have evidence you perpetuate myths

- accounts of "human origins" now are like ancient myths insofar as they fulfill similar functions
	- we know things happened "for the first time" around 3 mya, give or take
		- (how animals became humans)
	- yet, we don't know how
	- this becomes a canvas for fantasies
- the "canvas" of human prehistory is distinctively modern, in the sense that only in this modern era do we know that it existed at all (contra the Bible, etc)
- in pre-modern[^1] times, there wasn't "prehistory", there was just "history"
	- "prehistory" as a term: post-[[Brixham Cave discoveries in Devon in 1858]]
- prehistory is more than 3million years
	- there's little evidence for long periods of time in here
	- we don't want to make stuff up (more than we have to)
		- because (for one) when even scientists make things up it sounds like biblical narratives or myths

## 3. instead of "started the same and got different" it's more like "started completely different and ended up the same"

### 3.1. example: mitochondrial eve

- mitochondrial Eve, 1980
- one might have existed, it was speculated, after sequencing mitochondrial DNA, as recently as 120,000 years ago'
- popular magazines published stories about a modern counterpart to the Garden of Eden,[^2] like a "savanna-womb"

### 3.2. counter-evidence

- recent research
- rather than: starting out the same, then dispersing (Tower of Babel type myth)
- actually: early human populations in Africa were extraordinarily diverse
	- compared to which, biologically, living humans are barely distinguishable
		- look the same
		- in many ways act the same (rolling the eyes)
		- think the same
		- language the same (nouns, verbs, adjectives)
		- enjoy music and dancing
	- aka, we have no real basis for comparison
- actually: humans lived in all of Africa, not just eastern savannas
	- some populations were isolated for 100ks of years
	- more like a Tolkien world
	- modern human elements came together quite late
- coexisted with other species, like [[Homo naledi]]
- what were **these** societies like -- we have no idea
	- most of the time we have no idea what was "going on below the neck", let alone pigmentation, diet
- **what we do know**
	- we are composite products of this original mosaic of interaction, interbreeding, drifting, coming together,
- **what is likely**
	- “behaviors like mating and child-rearing practices, the presence or absence of dominance hierarchies or forms of language and proto-language must have varied at least as much as physical types, and probably far more.”

### 3.3. more

- modern humans appeared first in Africa
- expanded into Eurasia, encountered Neanderthals and Denisovans, and they all interbred
- only after those other populations extincted can we talk about a single human "us"
- **down to 40,000 bc, the social and physical world of our ancestors would have seemed radically different**
	- including flora and fauna
- so: very hard to draw analogies
	- as there's nothing in historical or ethnographic record that resembles this situation
- infer:
	- social organization among earliest ancestors was incredibly diverse
		- since; wide range of natural environments
		- physically diverse
		- social differences
	- so, no "original" form of human society
- so: insights that either search for, or rely on, an "original form of human society" are myth-making, and so can be only partial, since this was never the case

#subchapter *why the ‘sapient paradox’ is a red herring; as soon as we were human, we started doing human things*^[pp 83-86]

i'm not sure if they're saying that there was no cultural efflorescence 45kya, or that there was, but for reasons of seasonal population density rather than anything else; there is no mismatch between genetic and cultural clocks, as it were, since no one lived that densely before??

**terms:**

- the [[sapient_paradox]]: "why do so many tens of thousands of years stand between the biological origins of humanity[^1] and the widespread appearance of typically human forms of behavior; between when we became capable of creating culture and when we finally got round to doing it? What were we actually doing in the interim?”
- homo sapiens "emerged": (more of a dig) “when all the various elements of the modern human condition converged, definitively, in some stupendous moment of creation.” (obviously DoE believe this was not a thing that happened)
- culture: “complex symbolic human behavior” p 83

### 3.4. the sapient paradox is a mirage

- archaeological evidence from europe is rich
	- european governments are generally rich
	- european professional institutions have been pursuing prehistory longer "at home" then elsewhere
- in fact, with each year, new evidence accumulates for "early behavioral complexity elsewhere"
	- eg Panga ya Saidi cave site
		- Bornea and Sulawesi islands cave art
		- (future discoveries of complex pictorial art in africa)
- so:
	- Europe's "culture" late to the party
	- the "sudden cultural efflorescence" probably has to do with climate and demography
		- harsher and confined spaces
			- eg game-rich valleys (the space) bounded by tundra and dense coastal forests (the confiners)
		- ancestors moved between enclosed environments
		- so, density of human interactions radically increased, especially at certain times of year

#subchapter *why even very sophisticated researchers still find ways to cling to the idea that social inequality has an 'origin'*^[pp 85-87]

- points DoE is arguing against:
	- hunter-gatherers lived in a state of primordial innocence

- **Evolutionary Psychology** says (wrongly)
	- "dominance behavior is hardwired in our genes, so much so that “the moment society goes beyond tiny bands, it must necessarily take the form of some ruling over others."

### 3.5. analysis and Boehm and considering the implications

[Christopher Boehm](boehm_christopher.md)
- evolutionary anthropologist
- specialist in primate studies
- his arguments:
	- humans have instinct to engage in dom/sub behavior
		- this instinct is inherited from simian ancestors
		- (despite this instinct) humans are humans because they can choose to not act like that
		- itemizes tactics to humble any pretenders to dominance
			- these tactics don't have parallels with any primate (other than humans) behavior
			- his sources are ethnographic accounts of existing egalitarian foraging bands
				- eg. humans mock people for "chest-beating"
			- bullying is / may be instinctual, but "counter-bullying" is not
				- [actuarial intelligence](actuarial_intelligence.md)
					- similar to Aristotle's definition of humans as "political animals" - it's precisely what primates can't do

#### 3.5.1. Boehm's point:

- essence of humanity is being self-conscious political actors
	- corollary: humans can embrace wide range of social arrangements
	- implication: humans explored a wide range of social arrangements over history

#### 3.5.2. Boehm's conclusions:

- all humans until recently chose to follow same arrangements, that being "strictly egalitarian"[^6]
	- only with agriculture did humans follow hierarchy
- "social equality" and "social inequality" did not exist as concepts
	- [evidence]: recent survey of medieval literature finds no evidence of aequalitas or inaequalitas or cognates used to describe social relations before Columbus
- equality/inequality terms only "enter common currency" in early 17th century (1600s) after [natural law theory](natural_law_theory.md), which arose during debates about moral and legal implications of Europe's New World discoveries

[Boehm](boehm_christopher.md) doesn't consider the full implications of his notion of [actuarial intelligence](actuarial_intelligence.md) and how "the very essence of our humanity consists of the fact that we are self-conscious political actors"^[[Dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md) p 87]

#subchapter *in which we observe how grand monuments, princely burials and other unexpected features of ice age societies have upended our assumptions of what hunter-gatherers are like, and consider what it might mean to say there was ‘social stratification’ some 30,000 years ago* ^[pp 87-92]

## 4. upending assumptions of what hunter-gatherers are like, and arguments there was "social stratification" 30kya

- All of this back to the Ice Age:
	- monumentality
		- stone temples
			- [Göbekli Tepe](gobekli_tepe.md)
		- mammoth houses
			- [Yudinovo](Yudinovo)
	- rich burials / "princely burials"
		- [Sunghir](Sunghir.md)
		- [Lady of Saint-Germain-de-la-Rivière](lady_of_saint-germain-de-la-riviere.md)
	- trade centers
		- mammoth houses (extended area)
	- craft production centers
		- princely burials
- **responses**:^[p 91]
	- to project "institutional inequality" much further back in time:[^4]
		- G&W:
			- first, evidence is extremely sporadic
			- second, no other trappings of centralized power (fortifications, stronghouses, palaces)
			- sum: so, little to show ranked societies, and nothing to show states
			- how to actually explain this pattern of evidence:
				- pp "in which we dispose" (92)
- (now we're looking at political self-consciousness)
	- development of the dreamworld-folk write-off and its logical moves

### 4.1. princely, rich hunter-gatherer burials

- examples all over western Eurasia
	- in rock shelters
	- in open-air settlements
	- [Sunghir](Sunghir.md)
		- "many thousands of beads, laboriously worked from mammoth ivory and fox teeth"
			- 10,000 estimated work hours for beads
		- conjoined burials of two boys, "flanked by great lances made of straightened mammoth tusks"
	- Dolní Věstonice in the Moravian basin, south of Brno
		- triple burial with two men with headdresses, on either side of older man, on ochre-stained soil
	- Liguria coast
		- *Il Principe*: buried with what looks to us like royal regalia
	- Dordogne (further west)
		- [[lady_of_saint-germain-de-la-riviere]]: 16,000 year old burial of young woman
			- teeth from deer hunted in Spanish Basque 190 miles away
	- earliest ones from 34,000 - 26,000 years ago
- not cemeteries
- isolated burials of individuals or small groups
- bodies in striking postures and decorated with ornaments

- takes highly advanced and standardized methods of production to make 10,000 hours worth of beads
	- suggests specialized craftspeople
- exotic, prestigious materials brought from far away
- wealth buried with children (implying inherited status?)

### 4.2. monumental architecture

**monumentality**: relative concept; by the standards of their day, these structures detailed below must have been impressive (sophisticated design, large-scale labor coordination)

#### 4.2.1. evidence of such among hunter-gatherers back into Ice Age

- Europe
	- "public works" a feature of habitation in [Pleistocene](Pleistocene.md) from 25kyo to 12kyo, from "Krakow to Kiev"
		- on the "glacial fringe"
		- mammoth houses

##### 4.2.1.1. mammoth houses

- were not dwellings; they were monuments
- planned and constructed to commemorate a successful mammoth hunt (and solidarity of group)
- remains of "impressive circular structures"
- foundation of mammoth tusks and bones: would have produced conspicuous structures
- great wooden enclosures up to 130ft long
- often "became central places whose inhabitants exchanged amber, marine shells, and animal pelts"

- Eurasia
	- [[Yudinovo]] in Russia
		- 5 mammoth houses
	- [[Mezhirich]]
	- [[Kostenki]]
	- [Göbekli Tepe](gobekli_tepe.md)[^3]
		- "stone temples"
		- not an anomaly, as we saw above
			- (probably also had wooden counterparts)
		- 20 huge stone enclosures from 9000 bc, and repeatedly changed over hundreds of years
		- 200 pillars, linked by walls of rough stone
			- covered in unique carved images of dangerous animals and game animals
			- sometimes they are a "standing body" with humanoid limbs
		- in 9000 bc, the surroundings were woodland and steppe
		- definitely required large-scale coordinated activity
		- Question: who made them?
			- they were NOT proto-farmers:
				- these people didn't cultivate crops
				- though they did harvest and process wild cereals and plants in season
				- didn't orient lives around crop domestication

# 4.3.

## 5. hierarchy and the measure of time

#what
> To some, the raised location and orientation of the buildings at Göbekli Tepe suggest an astronomical or chronometric function, each chain of pillars aligned with a particular cycle of celestial movements. Archaeologists remain sceptical, pointing out that the structures may once have been roofed, and that their layout was subject to many alterations over time. But what has mostly intrigued scholars of different disciplines so far is something else: the apparent proof they offer that ‘hunter-gatherer societies had evolved institutions to support major public works, projects, and monumental constructions, and thus had a complex social hierarchy prior to their adoption of farming.’ Again, matters are not so simple, because these two phenomena – hierarchy and the measure of time – were closely interwoven.

#subchapter *in which we dispose of lingering assumptions that ‘primitive’ folk were somehow incapable of conscious reflection, and draw attention to the historical importance of eccentricity* ^[pp 92-98]

- Rousseau and the "stupid savage"
	- leads to comparing Ice Age humans to not humans but primates
	- means excising political consciousness from prehistoric humans
- return of sapient paradox in new form:
	- insisting either
		- that for countless millennia we had modern brains, but for some reason decided to live like monkeys anyway;
		- or that we had the ability to overcome our simian instincts and organize ourselves in an endless variety of ways, but for some equally obscure reason only ever chose one way to organize ourselves.

### 5.1. self-conscious political actor aka "the dreamworld-folk write-off and its logical moves"

- defining our terms
- philosophers: self-awareness
- neuroscientists: autopilot, habitual behavior
	- self-awareness is brief,
- G&W: great exception is during dialogue
	- "human thought is inherently dialogic"
		- dialogue books of ancient philosophers
		- only "fully self-conscious" when  "arguing" or "trying to solve common problem"
		- true *individual* self-consciousness only achieved by wise sages meditating

- it was assumed that "political consciousness" came first, until a few centuries ago in Western tradition
- **high-water mark of reaction against indigenous critique**
	- few centuries ago, Western phil abandons dialogue as typical mode of writing
		- same time: imagines isolated, rational, self-conscious individual as the normal default state
	- and, from 1700-1900, European philosophers saw *political* self-consciousness as an amazing accomplishment, and said it only happened with the Enlightenment, and the A/F Revolutions
		- (was assumed that, before that, people blindly followed traditions or word of God)
		- Victorian intellectuals even interpreted popular uprisings this way
	- considered not applicable for people to imagine alternative social order and try to bring it about up until Enlightenment, and even after that didn't think it would be good idea
- leads to, by late 19th century (late 1800s) people saying that someone like Kandiaronk, who "saw their society as a confederation created by conscious agreement; agreements open to continual renegotiation", couldn't even have existed
- primitive folk:
	- not capable of political self-consciousness
	- not capable of fully conscious thought on individual level (G&W: or conscious thought worthy of the name)
	- aka pre-logical mentality / mythological dreamworld
		- best: mindless conformists
		- worst: incapable of conscious, critical thought of any kind
- this **high-water-mark** allows them to:
	- write off Kandiaronk et all as "simple projections of Western 'noble savage' fantasies"
		- (because, in European, et al, minds, "real savages" were mindless dreamworld folk)
- logical moves:
	- if hunter-gatherers thought of this way do stuff like above (monuments, princely burials, etc) that doesn't fit the dreamworld-folk model, then they're bumped up to a "new stage of development"
		- eg now they are "complex" H-Gs
			- (but obvi still their stage defined by mode of subsistence, and role to enact a iron law of development which only we understand)

### 5.2. the penumbra (why is this here tho?) (i guess minor example of political self-consciousness? ) (also a reservoir of people)

- (oh, right, we'er getting into the princely burials?) (and maybe also the king's retainers?)
- [Zone of ritual play](zone_of_ritual_play.md) but as people:
- "the penumbra"
- skeptics and non-conformists
- exceptions: (which is leading to something …)
- [Primitive man as philosopher (1927)](radin_paul_primitive_man_as_philosopher_1927.md)
	- struck by the tolerance of eccentricity of the societies he studied
		- "logical extension of same rejection of coercion"
			- person would be made fun of, and friends and family would worry that gods would punish him
			- however, *they* woudl never punish him or force him into conformity, even by blaming him for a bad hunt and refusing to share food until he did the rituals
- Radin: what were the speculative stems of thought these characters created
	- (others): political implications: weirdos become leaders or spiritual figures
	- also a reserve of talent and insight
- [Nuer](nuer.md) as studied by [[Thomas Beidelman]]
	- "seriously unorthodox people"[^5]
		- politicians, bulls, earth priests, prophets
	- when great calamities or unprecedented events occurred – a plague, a foreign invasion – it was among this penumbra that everyone looked for a charismatic leader appropriate to the occasion.^[p 98]
	- even, sometimes, to propose entirely different visions of what Nuer society might be like.
		- (so i guess it's different in that it's also new things, not just a reservoir)

### 5.3. Nambikwara: definite example of political self-consciousness that's ignored because it doesn't fit the models ; also maybe starting to learn about Hierarchy+Chronometrics

#subchapter *what [Claude Lévi-Strauss](claude_levi-strauss.md) learned from the [[Nambikwara]] about the role of chiefs, and seasonal variations of social life* ^[pp 98-102]

#subchapter *in which we return to prehistory, and consider evidence for both ‘extreme individuals’ and seasonal variations of social life in the ice age and beyond* ^[pp 102-106]
- NOT evidence for hereditary aristocracy
- in the Paleolithic: there is evidence
	- (chronometrics) for seasonal variations of social structure
	- (hierarchy/social inequality) that highly anomalous individuals ("the ultimate individuals") played important political roles

#subchapter *concerning ‘buffalo police’ (in which we rediscover the role of seasonality in human social and political life)* ^[pp 106-111]

### 5.4. Clastres leaves seasonality out of his examples of political self-consciousness, and consequently the Lowie/Mauss tradition is lost in the 1960s

#subchapter *why the real question is not ‘what are the origins of social inequality?’ but ‘how did we get stuck?* ^[pp 112-118]

see notes [why_the_real_question_is_not_what_are_the_origins_of_social_inequality_but_how_did_we_get_stuck](why_the_real_question_is_not_what_are_the_origins_of_social_inequality_but_how_did_we_get_stuck.md)

### 5.5. seasonality is still with us, as festivals, which both "foster political self-consciousness" and "act as laboratories of social possibility"

- **festivals**:
	- "kept the old spark of political self-consciousness alive"^[p 117]
	- (later, will be the [Zone of ritual play](zone_of_ritual_play.md))
	- so it's both "awareness of pure alteration" and also a "reservoir" or "encyclopedia" for what to alternate to or from (aka "possible political forms")?
		- or "fostering political self-consciousness" and "as laboratories of social possibility"

(what is a waste of time to ask of festive rituals)
- are festive rituals expressions of authority, or vehicles for social creativity? Are they reactionary or progressive?^[p 118]

#subchapter *what being sapiens really means* ^[pp 118-119]

### 5.6. the capacity to "negotiate between alternatives" is what makes us human

### 5.7. book goals (mock 3): we'll be looking at why we are stuck

[^1]: "modern counterpart" in the sense that now, in modern times, it's our version of the Garden of Eden; **not** that we think the Garden of Eden is modern (aka exists now)>)
[^3]: p 89
[^4]: > abandon idea of Golden Age, conclude it was a hierarchical society, and that coercive power have been enduring forces behind social evolution ( p 91)
	- but also see its foreshadower:
  	> "some archaeologists now argue that, thousands of years before the origins of farming, human societies were already divided along lines of status, class and inherited power" (p 88)
[^5]: foreshadowing the "highly anomalous individuals" of p 102
[^6]: so Boehm also falls into this trap
