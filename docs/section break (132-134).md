# section break (132-134)

differences of status were thought of in terms of property at some point

and how control of it translated into power of command

then property got reframed in terms of work?

#tidbit

If anything, we should replace "origins of inequality" (and presumed equality) with "origins of aversion to being told what to do" (which I suppose is kind of what they're doing)[^1]

*Victorians try to convince everyone that everyone in the past worked even harder, and that things were going to slowly get better, until everyone was just leisure and affluence due to production increases*

#stuck
- real puzzle (sub puzzle of getting stuck) is not when the hierarchies appeared (because they could still be theatrical or segregated) but when you couldn't just laugh them away

- a doesn't necessarily lead to b

- turgot and smith
- technological progress prime mover
- liberation from toil was the goal
- campaigns to get 8 hour day
- counter campaign: primitive man was always struggling, so be glad you just have this! (we're just arguing about pace)
	- accepted as common sense 1900ish
