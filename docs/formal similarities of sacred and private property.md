# 1. in which we finally return to the question of property, and inquire as to its relation to the sacred (156-163)

[[Early Holocene]]
- cultural universes (now becoming distinct from one another)
- in "environments of abundance" rather than scarcity
	- ie more like [Calusa](calusa.md) than [!Kung](san_bushmen.md)

- what about their political arrangements?
	- #why are we asking this here?

- surplus doesn't inevitably lead to a mini-kingdom
	- just because Calusa did it. and even then, why did it happen with them?
		- imitating more powerful neighbors
			- as seafarers, were familiar with divine monarchies like [Great Sun of the Natchez](Natchez.md) and probably [[Central American empires]]
		- just odd
		- (maybe it wasn't even really a kingdom): don't know how much power Carlos had
			- probably an in-between, like Natchez

- [[Natchez Sun]]
	- not pure **empty theater** (dead stayed dead), but not a **court-court** (a la [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] or [[Aurangzeb]]) - **somewhere just in between**
		- unlimited power in his village
		- rituals of deference
		- arbitrary executions
		- BUT limited by physical presence
- most Natchez lived outside royal village
	- royal reps not treated seriously outside it, even laughed at

# 2. transition: sacred places and private property (157)

[James Woodburn](James_Woodburn.md), with his [immediate return hunter-gatherers](immediate_return_hunter-gatherers.md), found an exception to the ethos of personal autonomy in [free societies](free_societies.md), which were the [structures of exclusion](structures_of_exclusion.md) applied to "the [[sacred]]".

What Native Americans found so odd was that Europeans applied this concept to how they thought about human rights and freedoms:

| structure of exclusion |           |                         |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| sacred                 | linked to | supreme being           |
| private property       | sacred to | living human individual |

| society type                       | paradigm for human rights and freedoms       |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| free societies                     | personal autonomy and reciprocal obligations |
| [possessive individualism](possessive_individualism.md) societies | structure of exclusion                       |
