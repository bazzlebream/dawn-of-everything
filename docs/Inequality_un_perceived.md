# Inequality (un)perceived

“Alfani, Guido and Roberta Frigeni. 2016. ‘Inequality (un)perceived: the emergence of a discourse on economic inequality from the Middle Ages to the age of Revolution.’ Journal of European Economic History 45 (1): 21–66.”

> David found this PhD thesis by two Italian scholars where they had done word searches in Latin and every other language that might’ve been used in the Middle Ages. Obviously, terms for “equality” existed. But they weren’t used how we use them today. They weren’t, for example, used to discuss relationships between whole groups of people. And, certainly, there was no conception of an original state of humanity in which we were all equals.

> Yes, you can find references to that conception in classical literature and some medieval sources. But it was never taken for granted. It was just one way, among many, of imagining what we were like in the Garden of Eden. In fact, the Garden of Eden was hierarchical because Adam outranked Eve. [^1]
