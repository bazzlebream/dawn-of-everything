# David Graeber

## 1. techniques
- defining ill-defined terms, seemingly out of nowhere
	- [The dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md), p 125, egalitarianism

- how one thing 
- “ if one is trying to understand how control of property first came to be translated into power of command”
- “ the world of work would be the obvious place to look.”

- am i being forced to using the language of the oppressors ? / use someone else's questions or heuristics
	- having to talk about things in terms of "debt"
	- having to answer the question "origins of social inequality" rather than "how did we get stuck in one mode"

- applying notion of modalities to what is thought of as, uh  • • •
	- communism, hierarchy, exchange are modalities of transactions

- there's this way this something is always brought up
	- eg common questions, "the origins of inequality"
	- well, what's the intellectual history (IH) behind that very question?
		- (in this case, ironically) what are the *origins* of the question "what are the origins of inequality"
		- so, not: what's the IH of the answers to the question, but what's the IH of the existence of the question itself

- think of concepts as comprised of elements which are only accidentally (historically) together
	- the state
	- the way we talk about Consumption

- schemes reflect the author's political concerns
	- but how did they become canonical

- One way to test the value of a new approach is to see if it helps us explain what had previously seemed anomalous cases

- resist or at least really understand what is made to seem natural or obvious
	- creation of evolutionist theory (Turgot) largely to entrench dismissive attitudes towards periods like the above; to make them seem "natural" or "obvious"

- with two sides existed forever, what do they agree on? that's probably wrong or at least worth looking at
	- eg follows (from my notes)
	- debates between radicals and reactionaries didn't end, just pop up in different forms
		- today: right = Enlightenment; left = critics of En
	- but everyone agrees:
		- there was "The Enlightenment"
		- marked a break in human history
		- American and French revolutions were, in part, result of this rupture (break)
		- introducing possibility of self-conscious projects for reshaping society

- that we are the stupid ones

- if his mind looked like this, like having all these things in mind interconnected, but no signposting, it's insane that he wrote at all, or managed to do so linearly

- in comparative:
	- when you have multiple possibilities, look at the extremes (POWs with Wendat)

- sample of "going further"
- Now, it would be easy to make an argument that repressed aggression must be vented in one way or another, so that orgies of communal torture are simply the necessary flipside of a non-violent community; and some contemporary scholars do make this point.
But it doesn't relaly work. In fact, Iroquoia seems to be precisely one of those regions of North America where violence flared up only during certain specific historical periods and then largely disappeared in others. In what archaeologists term the ‘Middle Woodland’ phase, for instance, between 100 bc and ad 500 – corresponding roughly to the heyday of the Hopewell civilization – there seems to have been general peace.12 Later on, signs of endemic warfare reappear. Clearly, at some points in their history people living in this region found effective ways to ensure that vendettas didn’t escalate into a spiral of retaliation or actual warfare (the Haudenosaunee story of the Great Law of the Peace seems to be about precisely such a moment); at other times, the system broke down and the possibility of sadistic cruelty returned.

- reversing polarities
- > What this meant, in practice, was reversing a lot of polarities. It meant ditching the language of ‘equality’ and ‘inequality’, unless there was explicit evidence that ideologies of social equality were actually present on the ground. [^1]

- where they see breaks, you see continuity, and vice versa
	- aka they are putting the breaks in the wrong place
		- eg Agricultural Revolution

- a lot of tactics are people convincing some people what other (or "everyone else)") people think (s)
	- “What needs to be investigated, instead, might better be called the ‘myth of the myth of the noble savage’: why is it that certain Europeans began attributing such a naive position to others? ”
	- there is a more contemporary example i can't remember

- leaps like this:
- > After all, to an outside observer, a society where everyone was exactly the same, and one where they were all so completely different as to preclude any sort of comparison, would seem equally ‘egalitarian’.[Dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md) p 73
