# In the beginning … private property

## p1-3

> G&W argue that private property is primordial because it’s inseparable from religion. By way of illustration, they refer to the trumpets and other paraphernalia used in some indigenous traditions during boys’ coming-of-age ceremonies:

> [quoting DoE]: Now, these sacred items are, in many cases, the only important and exclusive forms of property that exist… It’s not just relations of command that are strictly confined to sacred contexts…, so too is absolute – or what we would today refer to as ‘private’ – property. In such societies, there turns out to be a profound formal similarity between the notion of private property and the notion of the sacred. Both are, essentially, structures of exclusion. (p. 159)

> Note how ‘absolute’ here gets translated as ‘private.’ The claim seems to be that if ritual property is sacred to an ‘absolute’ degree, then it qualifies by definition as ‘private property’.

This is not what they mean by "so too is absolute – or what we would today refer to as ‘private’ – property".

They are probably referring to the historical definition of the term "absolute property":

absolute

**5.a.** _Law_. Of property, a title, etc.: owned or held outright, unconditionally, or with a guarantee by the state that no one has a better right to it; owned as an estate in fee simple. Of a person: owning property in this way.In modern British use, _absolute title_ is a form of title which, when registered under the Land Registration Act (1925/2002) gives the registered person the strongest form of ownership of the registered freehold or leasehold interest.[^1]

1708 _Rastell's Termes de la Ley_ (new ed.) at _Property_ There are three manner of rights of Property; that is, Property absolute, Property qualified, and Property possessory.

They are just making a connection with historical terminology, not a connection to common meanings of the word "absolute" in an effort to say that it's "absolutely sacred". And actually the formal similarity is in the connection to a (higher) power, not necessarily the "absoluteness", which is not defined

## p4-5

> The conflation is reinforced when the authors seek authority for their association of religion with private property. At this pointG&W (p. 159) invoke Émile Durkheim’s classic definition of ‘the sacred’ as that which is ‘set apart’:

> Durkheim argued that the clearest expression of the sacred was the Polynesian term _tabu,_ meaning ‘not to be touched’. But when we speak of absolute, private property, are we not talking about something very similar – almost identical in fact, in its underlying logic and social effects?’

First, they don't associate "religion" with private property, they associate the logical structure of private property with the logical sructure of a sacred objects and knowledge.

## p6-8

> The authors then describe how ethnographers working with indigenous Amazonians discovered ‘that almost everything around them has an owner, or could potentially be owned, from lakes and mountains to cultivars, liana groves and animals.’ (p. 161) A spiritual entity’s sacred ownership of a species or resource sets it apart from the rest of the world. Similar reasoning, write G&W, underpins Western conceptions of private property. ‘If you own a car’, they explain, ‘you have the right to prevent anyone in the entire world from entering or using it’ (p. 159).

> It is quite breath-taking to find G&W conflating traditional notions of spiritual ‘ownership’ with ideas about owning your own car. On what planet are they when they view modern private ownership as ‘almost identical’ in its ‘underlying logic and social effects’ with a supernatural being’s ‘ownership’ of natural resources?

> When indigenous activists tell us that a lake or mountain is sacred to a powerful spirit, they are not endorsing anything remotely equivalent to ‘private property’. If the ‘Great Spirit’ owns the forest, the clear implication is that it is _not_ for sale, _not_ to be privatized, _not_ to be claimed by a logging company.

The theme that keeps coming up is that CK thinks DoE are politically and actively "endorsing" some regressive viewpoint, when usually they are trying to explain the history of a term or logical structure of thought or practice. Like here.

The things he lists ("_not_ for sale, _not_ to be privatized, _not_ to be claimed by a logging company") are differences with private property (which he also conflates with capitalism?) because of the Great Spirit's preferences, not because sacred ownership is not like private property ownership.** In fact, he's arguably reinforcing their point,** which is that everywhere except Roman Law notions of private property, ownership means caring, too, andn it's precisely the things he lists (_not_ for sale, _not_ to be privatized, _not_ to be claimed by a logging company) that are not-caring-for, but are acceptable to a legal system which views the rights to dispose of something to be the only ones that matter.

## p9

> One of the most powerful of Durkheim’s insights was that when people invoke Divinity, they are envisaging the moral force of their community as a whole. So, if a mountain belongs to God, that’s a way of declaring that it cannot be privatized. When G&W turn that round – claiming that the concept of ‘private property’ emerged inseparably from the very idea that _some things are sacred_ – you can see what a crude misrepresentation this is.

"claiming that the concept of ‘private property’ emerged inseparably from the very idea that _some things are sacred_ "
- first, they say "it's as old as", and aren't sure it has an origin ("“If private property has an ‘origin’, it is as old as the idea of the sacred, which is likely as old as humanity itself.”[^2]
- it's not that some things are sacred, it's that the creation or reproduction of sacredness involves violence, which even [free people](free%20societies.md) will do and ...

not sure how to argue this
