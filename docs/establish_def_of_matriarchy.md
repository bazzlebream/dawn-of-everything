# establish def of "matriarchy" That allows us to say it can't be excluded that it existed in time she's talking about


- meaning of "matriarchy"
	- one def: a society where women hold a preponderance of formal political positions
	- one/two ish: society in which *only* women expected to wield executive power or lead armies or create laws (this is gynarchy / gynaeocracy - political rule of women)
- matriarchy def 2B: 
	- role of mothers in household becomes a model for, and economic basis of, female authority in other aspects of life (doesn't necessitate dominance in a violence or exclusionary sense) where women as a result hold preponderance of overall day-to-day power
	- basically definition of patriarchy, with genders switched (and father instead of mother)

- 2B real enough
	- Kandiaronk in one
		- Wendat
	- Hopi
	- Zu√±i
	- Minangkabau
	- unusual in "ethnographic record" (last 200 yearsish)
	- so ... they are possible and could have existed then
