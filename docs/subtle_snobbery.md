# subtle snobbery

- [^2]indigenous account reproduced through a European is ignored
- no on denies outright that accounts of deliberative politics[^1] reflect historical reality
- but: no one finds it interesting
- the only interesting things
	- is the relation to European textual traditions,[^4] or expectations
	- "elaborate play acting": some sort of near-miraculous adaptation by ‘astute Indians’ to the political expectations of their European masters[^3]
		- G&W: educated opinion in Europe at this time (regarding Cronica) was almost uniformly anti-democratic -- it's the Spaniards who were learning something, if anyone

treatment of:

- [Crónica](cronica_de_la_nueva_espana.md)
- [[Tlaxcalan Actas]]

- naive romanticism / noble savage mything / condemnation
	> In the current intellectual climate, to suggest the Tlaxcalteca were anything but cynics or victims is considered just a tiny bit dangerous: one is opening oneself up to charges of naive romanticism.
	> In fact, these days more or less any attempt to suggest that Europeans learned anything at all of moral or social value from Native American people is likely to be met with mild derision and accusations of indulging in ‘noble savage’ tropes, or occasionally almost hysterical condemnation.
