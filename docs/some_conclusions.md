# some conclusions
[The dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md) p 204

- envivonmental determinists (together with economist rational calculation) are just the opposite pole from anthropologists who appeal to culture but refuse explanation, falling back on arbitrariness
- just because they can be stated as extremes, doesn't mean the positions have no truth to them
- yet, arbitrariness is just as deterministic as determinism[^1]

- that is, they both assume we're stuck
- that's why self-determination is important to us
	- we treat those who created these forms of culture (that we have today) as requiring political introspection and as intelligent adults capable of reflection
	- even this can be taken to extremes, like saying *everything* that happens to someone is their choice

- one reason there's not an answer to this issue (what issue?) is that there's really no way to know how much different "human agency" / "free will" makes - it's largely a matter of taste where you think freedom/determinism slider lands
- we're going to set it to the freedom side
- this means assuming that people probably were proceeding with a decent idea of what they were doing
	- eg slavery on northwest coast: overwhelming rejection of practice of slavery everywhere but the corner

- so what can we apply to similar forms of domination
	- nothing certain (“Complexity’ – as reflected in the co-ordination of labour or elaborate ritual systems – need not mean domination”)
	- seems likely, though, that simlar arrangements were emerging in some times and places
		- they did not go uncontested
	- domination begins at home
		- slavery is (in addition to origins in war) at first a domestic institution
			- brutal forms of exploitation have origins in perversions of nurture, love, and caring
	- [[inequality from below]]: hierarchy and equality tend to emerge together
		- domination appears on intimate, domestic level
		- self-consciously egalitarian politics emerge to prevent extension into public sphere

?? i got a bit lost here
