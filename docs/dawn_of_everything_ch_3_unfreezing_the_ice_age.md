# Dawn of Everything: Ch 3: Unfreezing the Ice Age (notes)

## 1. Unfreezing the Ice Age: intro

- [Unfreezing the Ice Age: intro](unfreezing_the_ice_age_intro.md)
	- we don't want to speculate about periods of time during "prehistory" (last 3 million years) for which we have little to no archaeological evidence, because that speculation is likely to just perpetuate myths

# when you don't have evidence you perpetuate myths

- accounts of "human origins" now are like ancient myths insofar as they fulfill similar functions
	- we know things happened "for the first time" around 3 mya, give or take
	- yet, we don't know how
	- this becomes a canvas for fantasies
- the "canvas" of human prehistory is distinctively modern, in the sense that only in this modern era do we know that it existed at all (contra the Bible, etc)
- in pre-modern[^1] times, there wasn't "prehistory", there was just "history"
	- "prehistory" as a term: post-[[Brixham Cave discoveries in Devon in 1858]]
- prehistory is more than 3million years
	- there's little evidence for long periods of time in here
	- we don't want to make stuff up (more than we have to)
		- because (for one) when even scientists make things up it sounds like biblical narratives or myths

## 2. example 1

- mitochondrial Eve, 1980
- one might have existed, it was speculated, after sequencing mitochondrial DNA, as recently as 120,000 years ago'
- popular magazines published stories about a modern counterpart to the Garden of Eden,[^2] like a "savannah-womb"

### 2.1. counterpoint

- *instead of "started the same and got different" it's more like "started completely different and ended up the same"*

### 2.2. counterevidence

- recent research
- rather than: starting out the same, then dispersing (Tower of Babel type myth)
- actually: early human populations in Africa were extraordinarily diverse
	- compared to which, biologically, living humans are barely distinguishable
		- look the same
		- in many ways act the same (rolling the eyes)
		- think the same
		- language the same (nouns, verbs, adjectives)
		- enjoy music and dancing
	- aka, we have no real basis for comparison
- actually: humans lived in all of Africa, not just eastern savannahs
	- some populations were isolated for 100ks of years
	- more like a Tolkein world
	- modern human elements came together quite late
- coexisted with other species, like [[Homo naledi]]
- what were **these** societies like -- we have no idea
	- most of the time we have no idea what was "going on below the neck", let alone pigmentation, diet
- **what we do know**
	- we are composite products of this original mosaic of interaction, interbreeding, drifting, oming together,
- **what is likely**
	- “behaviours like mating and child-rearing practices, the presence or absence of dominance hierarchies or forms of language and proto-language must have varied at least as much as physical types, and probably far more.”

### 2.3. more

- modern humans appeared first in Africa
- expanded into Eurasia, encountered Neanderthals and Denisovans, and they all interbred
- only after those other populations extincted can we talk about a single human "us"
- **down to 40,000 bc, the social and physical world of our ancestors would have seemed radically different**
	- including flora and fauna
- so: very hard to draw analogies
	- as there's nothing in historical or ethnographic record that resembles this situation
- infer:
	- social organization among earliest ancestors was incredibly diverse
		- since; wide range of natural environments
		- physically diverse
		- social differences
	- so, no "original" form of human society
- so: insights that either search for, or rely on, an "original form of human society" are myth-making, and so can be only partial, since this was never the case
	- this includes theories like Hrdy

[^1]: "modern counterpart" in the sense that now, in modern times, it's our version of the Garden of Eden; **not** that we think the Garden of Eden is modern (aka exists now)>)

#subchapter ^[why the ‘sapient paradox’ is a red herring; as soon as we were human, we started doing human things, pp 83-86]

i'm not sure if they're saying that there was no cultural efflorescence 45kya, or that there was, but for reasons of seasonal population density rather than anything else; there is no mismatch between genetic and cultural clocks, as it were, since no one lived that densely before??

**terms:**

- the [[sapient_paradox]]: "why do so many tens of thousands of years stand between the biological origins of humanity[^1] and the widespread appearance of typically human forms of behaviour; between when we became capable of creating culture and when we finally got round to doing it? What were we actually doing in the interim?”
- homo sapiens "emerged": (more of a dig) “when all the various elements of the modern human condition converged, definitively, in some stupendous moment of creation.” (obviously DoE believe this was not a thing that happened)
- culture: “complex symbolic human behaviour” p 83

the sapient paradox is a mirage:

- archaeological evidence from europe is rich
	- european governments are generally rich
	- european professional institutions have been persuing prehistory longer "at home" then elsewhere
- in fact, with each year, new evidence accumulates for "early behavioral complexity elsewhere"
	- eg Panga ya Saidi cave site
		- Bornea and Sulawesi islands cave art
		- (future discoveries of comple pictorial art in africa)
- so:
	- Europe's "culture" late to the party
	- the "sudden cultural efflorescence" probably has to do with climate and demography
		- harsher and confined spaces
			- eg game-rich valleys (the space) bounded by tundra and dense coastal forests (the confiners)
		- ancesetors moved between enclosed environments
		- so, density of human interactions radically increased, especially at certain times of year

#subchapter ^[why even very sophisticated researchers still find ways to cling to the idea that social inequality has an 'origin' pp 86-87]

[Boehm](boehm_christopher.md) doesn't consider the full implications of his notion of [actuarial intelligence](actuarial_intelligence.md) and how "the very essence of our humanity consists of the fact that we are self-conscious political actors"^[[Dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md) p 87]
