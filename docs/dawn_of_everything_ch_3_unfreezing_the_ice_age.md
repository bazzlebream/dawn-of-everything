# Dawn of Everything: Ch 3: Unfreezing the Ice Age (notes)

## 1. Unfreezing the Ice Age: intro

- [Unfreezing the Ice Age: intro](unfreezing_the_ice_age_intro.md)

## 2. why the ‘sapient paradox’ is a red herring; as soon as we were human, we started doing human things

i'm not sure if they're saying that there was no cultural efflorescence 45kya, or that there was, but for reasons of seasonal population density rather than anything else; there is no mismatch between genetic and cultural clocks, as it were, since no one lived that densely before??

**terms:**

- the [[sapient paradox]]: "why do so many tens of thousands of years stand between the biological origins of humanity[^1] and the widespread appearance of typically human forms of behaviour; between when we became capable of creating culture and when we finally got round to doing it? What were we actually doing in the interim?”
- homo sapiens "emerged": (more of a dig) “when all the various elements of the modern human condition converged, definitively, in some stupendous moment of creation.” (obviously DoE believe this was not a thing that happened)
- culture: “complex symbolic human behaviour” p 83

the sapient paradox is a mirage:

- archaeological evidence from europe is rich
	- european governments are generally rich
	- european professional institutions have been persuing prehistory longer "at home" then elsewhere
- in fact, with each year, new evidence accumulates for "early behavioral complexity elsewhere"
	- eg Panga ya Saidi cave site
		- Bornea and Sulawesi islands cave art
		- (future discoveries of comple pictorial art in africa)
- so:
	- Europe's "culture" late to the party
	- the "sudden cultural efflorescence" probably has to do with climate and demography
		- harsher and confined spaces
			- eg game-rich valleys (the space) bounded by tundra and dense coastal forests (the confiners)
		- ancesetors moved between enclosed environments
		- so, density of human interactions radically increased, especially at certain times of year
