# agriculture is a necessary foundation for durable inequalities
- a viewpoint
- obvi was [Dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md) arguing against

#argument-strategy
- responses to cases like the [[Calusa]]
	- ignore them
	- claim they are an insignificant anomaly (ie invoke the [[no_true_scottsman]] fallacy[^1]
		- surely these people aren't "true" foragers because of " raiding their neighbours, stockpiling wealth, creating elaborate court ceremonial, defending their territories"
		- or they are "farmers by other means" (they are agriculturing with wild crops, for instance)
		- or they are in transition, "on the way" to becoming farmers

## 1. possible responses
> Foragers are **populations which don’t rely on biologically domesticated plants and animals as their primary sources of food.** Therefore, if it becomes apparent that a good number of them have in fact possessed complex systems of land tenure, or worshiped kings, or practiced slavery, 
> - **this altered picture of their activities doesn’t somehow magically turn them into ‘proto-farmers’**. 
> - Nor does it justify the invention of endless sub-categories like ‘complex’ or ‘affluent’ or ‘delayed-return’ hunter-gatherers
	> - which is simply another way of ensuring such peoples are kept in what the Haitian anthropologist [[Michel-Rolph Trouillot]] called the ‘[[savage slot]]’, their **histories defined and circumscribed by their mode of subsistence** – as if they were people who really ought to be lazing around all day, but for some reason got ahead of themselves.
> - Instead, it means that the initial assertion was, like that of the apocryphal Hamish McDonald, simply wrong.[^2]
