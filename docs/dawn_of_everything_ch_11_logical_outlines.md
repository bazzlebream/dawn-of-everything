# Dawn of Everything: Ch 11: Full Circle (logical outlines)

## Outline 1: Humans are not determined by forces outside their control

## terms
- properly historical event: an event that:
	- could not have been predicted beforehand
	- only happens once

## general considerations

### on speculating about "what might have happened instead"
- When you ask things like "Ok but what if Hitler was never born", considering that possibility can *raise profound questions*, but you can't ever expect to find an answer to the consideration itself, as the past is fixed, and asking about counterfactual[^1] alternatives in this way doesn't even really make sense.
- Instead, what you want to do is comparative explorations to at least discover possible patterns of events (not trying to predict the future).[^2]
- In order to do these comparisons, though, you need at least two things to compare to one another. And, presumably, the more different things you can compare, the better you'll be able to identify patterns, and perhaps assert their universality.
- In other words, you can ask "what actually did happen instead."

## outline
- (forces outside human control)
	- inevitability of evolutionist scheme
	- changes only occur by change, huge, revolutionary breakthroughs (europeans coming in)
		- anyone who doesn't directly or indirectly experience Enlightenment is non-selfconscious political dupe

### the evolutionist scheme was not historically inevitable (and also there were always other real and possible options)
- why what that scheme describes is not inevitable
- why, or in what forms, belief in the scheme persist, despite evidence to the contrary
	- [ • • •]
	- Turgot
	- different ontology argument

#### the comparative technique lets us look at an alternative to what's "inevitable": the Hopewell Interaction Sphere
- characterization
	- [ • • •]
	- types of 3 forms of domination
- origins & maintenance
	- ritual and diplomatic system
- why it disproves inevitability of evolutionist schema

#### the comparative technique continues to let us look at Cahokia, which looks like a grain state, but isn't
- characterization
	- [ • • •]
- disproves inevitability
	- not controlled from center (so not actual empire)
	- self-conscious rejection of that system; mass defections
	- even if it became third-order regime, which it tried to, would have looked much different to modern states

### disproving: ok, but what looks like self-conscious was only because Enlightenment Europeans came in and that's where they got the ideas from

#### the comparative technique continues to let us look at the post-Mississippian world
- characterization
	- [ • • •]
- disproves inevitability
	- (typically this already-not-fits-evolutionary-schema) is explained by saying Europeans caused it
		- this also relates to disproving reliance on the "big breaks" or "big revolutions" explanations for why humans change
	- but, it's really the end of process of dismantling cahokia

#### why the Enlightenment isn't special; and why others have political self-consciousness
- the Osage self-consciously create, store infor among selves democratically
- montesque, generally regarded as originator, was after these ideas came back to europe

#### why the people who didn't live in post-Cahokia also knew about states self-consciously
- lived near Attiwandaronk
	- self-consciousness shows up in myth / who is a witch




[^1]: counterfactual, adj. Relating to or expressing what has not happened or is not the case. (A fancy term for "what might have happened if x or y had been the case instead" .)
[^2]: From what I understand, the difference here is very much the difference, in quantum mechanics experiments, from (i) trying to predict exactly where a photon will land (looking for a specific answer to "but what if such and such happened instead") and (ii) describing the waveform, or "probability distribution", of where the photon might land.
