# detournement

> The style of writing is what in fiction may be considered pastiche, or more accurately, a _detournement_ in which historical flashpoints are turned about-face from their conventional understandings. For a book that is heavily signposted, it can be difficult at times to follow where the argument is headed, or what larger point is being made. This is because the authors appear to intervene right at the moments when other writers might jump to a conclusion in the service of some underlying Idea, either showing us alternative pathways or slowly returning to the original trajectory. The effect of these motions is to demystify both the complexity and the simplicity of human actions and decisions. At one point, following a description into Wendat dream interpretation practices as a kind of communal psychoanalysis, the authors respond to a theory that Iriquois tribesâ€™ famed inter-tribal ritual and diplomacy came from some long-forgotten trading empire by suggesting that such strategies might have simply emerged from earlier ritual and diplomacy.[^1]
