# Dawn of Everything: Ch 11: Full Circle (notes)


Wendat notions of freedom still with us

## 1. clarification

- the idea of human societies evolving over time was not special
- what was special: (and what constitutes the European backlash against the [[Indigenous Critique]])
	- classifying societies by means of subsistence
		- allowing agriculture to be seen as a break or revolution
	- assuming that societies grew more complex as they increased in size
	- defining this complexity as not merely a greater differentiation of functions, but a top-down government of hierarchically ranked groups of people[^2]

## 2. § in which we consider James C. Scott’s arguments about the last 5,000 years and ask whether current global arrangements were, in fact, inevitable

### 2.1. responding to objections like: weren't these things inevitable given a certain amount of time, despite the alternate possibilities?

- [[theory of the agricultural trap]]:
	- Cereal agriculture was "predisposed" to the fiscal requirements of extractive states, even if it didn't directly cause their rise[^3]
	- but also a trap for the "grain states" themselves, insofar as they were limited to areas of intensive agriculture, with highlands, fens, and marshes beyond their reach
		- also fragile in and of themselves:
			- collapse from overpopulation
			- ecological devastation
			- endemic diseases
	- "dark twins" with the (grain state/) anarchist/monarchist barbarian hill people
		- 3000 bc to 1600 ad bad for farmers, good for barbarians, and defectors of the lowlands could join barbarians (freedom to move away)

so, returning:

- since this system existed for 4600 years (a long time), then how inevitable, really, were the governments at the "end" of the "evolutionary" path to states. was this really the necessary culmination?

unfortunately evolutionism catches on

- **by late 1800s**, clear that Turgot's sequence wasn't true
	- but, Darwin's theories = evolutionism is only approach to history given credence
		- [Lewis Henry Morgan](Lewis_Henry_Morgan.md)'s [Ancient Society](Ancient_Society.md)
		- Marxists, simlar
		- (these unworkable too, thrown out)
- **1950s**: neo-evolutionist theory (based on efficiency of "harvesting" energy from environment)
	- today, no one subscribes to whole package; many say they've moved on
	- but, even if they have, there's no alternative vision in place
	- so, laypeople and even scientists who aren't archaeologists or anthropologists fall back on older scheme

#### 2.1.1. evolutionist scheme basic sequence (446)

- [ • • • details of this skipped]
	- band societies
	- tribes
	- chiefdoms
	- states

##### 2.1.1.1. critiques from 20th century anthropologists

- this doesn't work either

##### 2.1.1.2. evolutionist response to critique

- keep the scheme, but finesse it[^4]

##### 2.1.1.3. disjunctures around use of schemes like this

- cultural anthropologists view as a relic that no one could take serious
- archaeologists only use terms (tribe, chiefdom, state) for lack of alternative
- however, it's still treated as "self-evident basis" for discussions
	- difficult to imagine history that's not teleological

##### 2.1.1.4. living in history

- impossible to predict future
- but the past is fixed, and even asking what "could" have happened doesn't make real sense
- #term "properly historical event" : has, perhaps, two qualities:
	- it could not have been predicted beforehand,
	- but it only happens once
- it's idle to ask what might have been, even if it "raises profound questions", those questions can never be answered

##### 2.1.1.5. proceeding by comparison

- what we can do is "engage in a project of comparison
	- sort of things that *might* happen
	- pattern(s) by which things follow one another
	- but **we can't even really compare anymore** since pre-Span invaded Americas, since there's only one political-economic system and it's global
		- can't just if things are connected or separate things that happen to come together
- **but, some say, we could never really compare**
	- most of human history, Eurasia and Africa were one interconnected system
	- but, you can't say it's meaningless to compare
	- you also can't say patterns are universal, since they may just be what happened there
- well, there was a real exception to the single system: the Americas (not part of the world system)
	- so, can ask: "does history have to take a certain direction"
		- rise of monarchy inevitable?
		- cereal agriculture a trap?
			- **only matter of time before warlord establishes administered violence?**
			- inevitable others will copy him?
	- pre-Columbian North America shows us: no, these aren't inevitable
		- movement away from agriculture in western north america
		- Plains societies alternated society types during the year
		- and the big one: Cahokia

##### 2.1.1.6. case study: Cahokia: evolutionist schema is not historically inevitable (452)

- 1050-1350 ad
- (now) East St Louis
- classic budding "grain state" dissolves, and "polis-sized tribal republics, in ecological balance with environment", emerge
- site of Cahokia abandoned for centuries

###### 2.1.1.6.1. how did the evolutionist _view_ become fixed: [the 'different ontology' argument](the_different_ontology_argument.md)

- creation of evolutionist theory (Turgot) largely to entrench dismissive attitudes towards periods like the above; to make them seem "natural" or "obvious"
	- [ • • •] (454)
	- "real dialogue is impossible"
- **counteracting the 'different ontology' argument**
	- [[Ondinnonk]]- Freudian dream psychoanalysis anticipated by 250 years
		- except in this case, it was collective therapy ("[[Dream-guessing]]")
		- the winter months in a [[Wendat]] town were largely devoted to organizing collective feasts and dramas, literally in order to make some important man or woman’s dreams come true.

## 3. § in which we ask how much of north America came to have a single uniform clan system, and consider the role of the ‘hopewell interaction sphere'

#question why?

### 3.1. history of Eastern Woodlands from 200-1600 ad

- Turtle Island = North America

#### 3.1.1. the puzzle of: how did continent-spanning clan systems emerge when everyone spoke a different language, and other impediments (455)

- [[Elizabeth Tooker]]
	- first, not even sure the clans should be considered "kinship groups" at all
		- more like ritual societies (spiritual relation with totem animal, only figuratively their "ancestor")
		- nobody keeps track of genealogies
		- no ancestor cults or descent-based property claims
		- all clans equal
		- hardly any collective property (except things for rituals, dances, chants, sacred object, and name collections)

##### 3.1.1.1. ritual: on names (which are also titles) collections (still Tooker) (456)

#question why?
- #tidbit "the fusing of titles and names is a peculiarly North American phenomenon"
-fixed stock of names assigned to children
- names owned by clan
- not directly inherited
- assigned to most likely candidate on death of current holder of title
- community never just one clan
	- quite a number
	- grouped into moieties: rivals and complements
- effect: efface personal histories from public contexts

##### 3.1.1.2. diplomacy: on clans (still Tooker) (456)

- clans key in diplomacy
	- hospitality to travelers
	- organize protocol for diplomatic missions
	- compensation payments to prevent war
	- incorporate prisoners
- almost seems **designed** to maximize people's ability to "move" and "reshuffle social arrangements"
- where did this come from?
	- Tooker: remains of long-forgotten "trading empire" established by central Mexico merchants
		- however, there's no evidence of this

##### 3.1.1.3. so, where does the system come from?

- G&W: ritual and diplomacy (since it's a ritual and diplomatic system)
	- [[hopewell_interaction_sphere]]: active ties developed between all parts of North America
		- a network with its epicentre in the Scioto and Paint Creek river valleys of Ohio.
			- tombs
				- 100 bc - 500 ad
				- treasures under burial mounds
				- materials from all over
				- used to make ritual gear and costumers
				- located near gigantic earthworks, some miles across
					- (Central Ohio people creating them since [[Adena period, 1000 bc]])
					- sophisticated star calculations and accurate measurement
					- some were made over time
						- (mobilization of lots of labor, or merely side-effect of dancing-grounds or flat open spaces for feasts, games, assemblies - every year flattened and swept, so material might have just piled up over 100s of years)
						- [[Muskogee]] did it with rotating officials organizing, no top-down structures required
					- some were planned in advance
						- [[Poverty Point]] or [[Hopewell earthworks]] or [[Newark Earthworks in Licking County, Ohio]]
						- in river valleys, close to water
						- so, lots of engineering to keep them from just washing away
						- circles, squares, and octagons made of mud
						- Newark Earthworks:
							- lunar observatory
							- two square miles
							- 16 foot tall embankments
							- "ingenious building techniques"
							- cosmogonic miracle, since never melted

##### 3.1.1.4. tangent: Hopewell geometrical system

- another example of shared things across continent:
	- system of measurement: arranging cords into equilateral triangles
		- marks break with past custom
- earthworks based on this system on upper and lower Mississippi valley
- size of small towns with
	- meeting houses
	- craft workshops
	- charnel houses
	- crypts
- empty for most of the year
- only filled during specific rituals

#### 3.1.2. puzzle no. 2: not becoming a grain state shows irrelevant of evolutionist terminology

- all the ingredients to form classic "grain state", but didn't
	- didn't even create ongoing village or town life
- very fertile area
- but avoided maize cropping except for ritual purposes
- avoided fertile valley bottoms
- isolated homesteads in higher ground
- mostly a diverse food economy
	- pursuing a combination of hunting, fishing, foraging and cultivating local weedy crops in small garden plots; sunflowers, sumpweed, goosefoot, knotweed and maygrass, along with a smattering of vegetables
- little evidence for warfare or organized violence

- (the monument) architecture then, didn't come from agricultural surplus governed by chief or religious class
- instead, "play farming"
- shamans and engineers who had half a dozen pals and then sometimes at these festivals addressed the whole continent

#### 3.1.3. Hopewell: what were they like? (460)

- artistically brilliant
	- the way used objects were decorated
	- imagery like shamanic rituals, vision quests, soul journeys, mirrors, festivals of the dead
- **elemental principle of domination: information**
	- social influence from control over esoteric knowledge
	- however, there's no center or capital to [[hopewell_interaction_sphere]]
	- no permanent elites
	- burial insignias show at least 12 sets
		- developed clan system too (bits of totem animal in tombs)
	- virtually no relationship between a clan and a specific office (not hereditary or ranked)

- maybe ritual was feasts and contests? in which case, if they were like others, buried treasure, which kept people from accumulating, and make sure social differences were only in theater

##### 3.1.3.1. Tripartite Alliance (461)

- the ritual system, following this [[Tripartite Alliance]], accounts for most of the social differences seen in the rituals (rather than, say, hereditary rank of clans or whatever other bad thing)
- northernmost alliance:
	- funerary assemblages
		- shamanic ritual (heroic men traveling between cosmic areas)
		- all buried with badge of office are men
- southern
	- eg Turner Site in southwest Ohio
	- funerary assemblages
		- impersonal masked figures
		- hilltop earth shrines
		- chthonic monsters
		- all buried with same badges of office (as north?) are only women
- center
	- mixed!
- general
	- systematic coordination between clusters, and joining causeways

### 3.2. ¶ (462) compare Hopewell Interaction Sphere with 'Ubaid village societies

- both:
	- culture areas on largest possible scale
		- entire span of river system, headwater to delta, all surrounding plans and coastlands
			- HIS: Mississippi
			- Ubaid: Euphrates
	- regular cultural interaction
		- Ubaid: self-conscious standardization, social egalitarianism, **laid foundation for world's first cities**
		- Hopewell:
			- (see below)

#### 3.2.1. differences

##### 3.2.1.1. Ubaid

- unity from suppression of individual differences

##### 3.2.1.2. Hopewell

- unity in celebration of difference
	- no two Hopewell art figures have same hair [^5]
	- idiosyncrasies
- but also somehow coordinated over the huge area
	- "ritual landscape"
	- earthworks aligned with each other to represent parts of the calendar or ceremonial cycle
		- imagine engineering this, let alone transforming it over the whole continent

###### 3.2.1.2.1. Hopewell's work is done

- Feasts of the Dead: resurrection of names
- mechanism for disseminating structure of clan system?
- end of big burials in 400 ad because "work was done" (ie idiosyncratic art turns to standardized, disseminated version, and great treks no longer required to tie groups together, as they had now shared "idiom" for personal diplomacy and rules for interacting with strangers )

## 4. § in which we tell the story of cahokia, which looks like it ought to be the first ‘state’ in america (463)

### 4.1. ¶ another fucking puzzle: Hopewell social arrangements anticipate later institutions

- moeity-type divisions, like of white and red clans, and peace and war administrations
	- war, however, probably just games of lacrosse or something even more theatrical

history period: [[decline of Hopewell centers, ad 400 - 800]]

- groups adopt maize as staple, grow in river valleys
- actual armed conflict increases in frequency
- populations live longer around the earthworks
	- small towns even centered on pyramids and plazas
	- some fortified
	- surrounded by no-man's land
	- even tiny kingdoms
- leads to urban explosion
	- epicenter at [Cahokia](Cahokia.md) (to begin with, was probably a place of pilgrimage)

#### 4.1.1. Cahokia (as extended from Hopewell period)

- also love of games

##### 4.1.1.1. chunkey

- [[chunkey]] invented ~ 600 ad
	- social terms: substitute for, or continuation of, war
	- tied into legend
	- focus of gambling, when some staked their families or themselves
- lets us chart rise of social hierarchies
	- monopolized by exclusive elite
		- stone chunkeys stop being in regular burials, and really ornate versions are in richest graves
- becoming spectator sport

##### 4.1.1.2. back to Cahokia & elites

- Cahokia the sponsor of a regional elite
- increased in size geometrically in 1050 ad
	- six square miles
	- 100 earthen mounds
	- spacious plazas
	- + 10,000 people = 40,000 in [[American Bottom]] total

##### 4.1.1.3. main part of Cahokia

- master plan
- single "burst" of activity
- [[Monk's Mound]]: huge earth pyramid
	- enormous plaza
	- nearby "woodhenge"
- pyramids topped with
	- palaces
	- temples
	- charnel houses
	- sweat lodges
- tried to move important people from elsewhere into new thatch houses in elite neighborhoods with craft specializations or ethnic identity
- surveillance over residential zones
- existing villages in hinterland disbanded
- rural population dispersed

[ • • •]

- dismantling of self-governing communities outside city
	- (turn into centralized around cult of a royal line and receive Cahokia patronage[^6])
- old moiety system transformed into opposition between nobles and commoners
- genealogies carefully preserved
- priesthood maintained temples

- bird-man symbolism
	- commoners can win way into nobility by getting hero title
	- marked in smaller kingdoms
- smaller kingdom imagery: these badges and insignia made at cahokia
- but in cahokia itself: the Corn Mother (Old Woman holding loom)
- small kingdoms in aggressive conflict with neighbors
- trade routes
	- materials for treasures go to American Bottom / Cahokia

- despite this, not controlled from center (so not actual empire)
- rather, "intricate ritual alliance" backed up by force

- violence increases quickly
- 1150 ad giant palisades built at Cahokia
	- war, destruction, depopulation
- bad memories
	- erasure of
		- birdman myth/images
		- Cahokia in oral traditions
		- 1400 ad, fertile American Bottom called Vacant Quarter or Empty Quarter
			- "a haunted wilderness of overgrown pyramids and housing blocks crumbling back into swamp, occasionally traversed by hunters but devoid of permanent human settlement."[^7]

### 4.2. ¶ (467) Cahokia system complete collapse: how?

- Cahokia = Second-order regime
	- control over violence
	- charismatic politics
- same as:
	- [[Classic Maya]] elite

- the missing piece, managerial/bureaucratic:
	- admin of otherworldly matters
	- sophisticated ritual calendars
	- "orchestration" of sacred space
	- (these did have actual effects)
		- design of cities
		- mobilizing labor
		- surveillance
		- maize cycle monitoring
	- (so, looks like an **attempt** at a Third-order regime)
		- still would have been different to modern nation states
	- #what ? explains why collapse is total

1350 - 1400 ad, mass defection
- "migration" for Cahokia descendents is all 3 elementary forms of freedom:
	> restructuring of an entire social order, merging our three elementary freedoms into a single project of emancipation: to move away, to disobey and to build new social worlds.
- aka "constitutional change"

- example of group who "migrated" in this sense:
- the [[Osage]] call it "moving to a new country"
	- not hard to relocate in NA
		- population sparse
		- stretches of uninhabited territory
- #tidbit "What we would now call social movements often took the form of quite literal physical movements."

#### 4.2.1. ideological conflicts, case study: Etowah river valley

(*I'm not sure this section is ideological conflicts at all*)
- town of [[Etowah]] becomes the capital of "some sort of kingdom" by 1300 ad ish?
- sacked in 1375 ad, and it was abandoned

in Southeast: priestly orders replaced by warrior [[micas]] (petty rulers)

- 1500 ad Etowah valley comes under kingdom of Coosa
- petty kingdoms like this become dominant political form in Southeast in 1500-1700
	- brittle and unstable rule
	- rulers treated with reverence, got tribute
- outside central towns: more egalitarian forms taking  • • • form

## 5. § on how the collapse of the Mississippian world and rejection of its legacy opened the way to new forms of indigenous politics around the time of the European invasion (470-474)

### 5.1. ¶ [470-474]

- [untitled]
	- by early 18th century (1720s?), this vanished in American South and Midwest
		- petty kingdoms
		- practice of building mounds and pyramids
	- replaced by
		- people who lived in homesteads at the edge of prairies and migrated seasonally, leaving the young and old in earthwork towns
		- towns made into ceremonial centers or "hollow courts", still respected *mico*, then, when they died, people went back into valleys in more egalitarian communities
- [interpretations]
	- historians see this as because of Europeans
	- but it's clear this was end of a long process going on for a long time
	- or outcome of "self-conscious social movements, centered on the summer [[Green Corn]] ceremonies"
		- figure: looped square (no precedent in old Mississippian towns)
		- competing myth-stories capture some of the past
			- "priests claiming to be sent from heavens with special knowledge"
			- paternalistic theocracy were massacred by the people sick of their shit
- what made tribal divisions, familiar from the ethnographies, possible
	- demographics (sparse, easy to move and reconfigure food getting)
	- women take on stronger political roles
- struggles over the forms of domination, hereditary leadership and esoteric knowledge
	- Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole (in American Southeast)
	- all governed by communal councils, consensus-finding
	- yet all has priests, castes, and princes, or at least traces of them
- life was a lot like we hear it was during the Enlightenment
	- with the implication the Enlightenment wasn't the result of a special civilizing process that only affected Europe
	- tobacco & coffee (in small doses for everyone: converse of shamans) while talking about politics

## 6. § how the Osage came to embody the principle of self-constitution, later to be celebrated in Montesquieu’s *The spirit of the laws* (474-481)

### 6.1. ¶ (474) we're going to be talking about the Reformation, and logical structure of reformations

- relationship between esoteric / bureaucratic knowledge
	- [ • • •] not sure of the point, exactly
	- both can be form of domination, and get converted into administrative power (and basis for sovereignty)

### 6.2. ¶ (475)

#### 6.2.1. principle of esoteric knowledge challenged

- in Europe, Reformation [ • • •] translating the bible, etc
- in Hopewell, basically like the Reformation in Europe, except what was "reformed" were the maths describing how to capture the sacred in spatial form (through the earthworks)

#### 6.2.2. reformation (re: esoteric knowledge)

##### 6.2.2.1. parts

- who gets to partake of sacred power in stories and myths
	- encoded in scripture (Europe) aka old/new Testaments
	- encoded in landscape monuments network (Hopewell)
		> indeed, there is every reason to think that the images of chthonic and other beings frozen in ancient earthworks were testaments of a sort. they were mnemonic schemes that prompted the recollection and re-enactment of exploits carried out by founding ancestors at the beginning of days and magnified in monumental form, to be witnessed by the powers dwelling ‘on high’. [^8]

##### 6.2.2.2. types of reformation of knowledge

- types:
	- Enlightenment-style: systematic rejection of esoteric knowledge
	- Osage:
		- **democratization of such knowledge**
		- transformation of theocratic elite into kind of oligarchy

#### 6.2.3. case study: Osage: what it "meant actually" to go through this transformation

- Great Plans nation
- trace most of ritual and myth back to Midwestern origins (Mississippianized Fort Ancient people)
- allied with French and maintain independence, with trading empire, from 1678-1803
- [[Francis La Flesche]], native Omaha language speaker, was ethnographer, so … pretty good
- communities move between three seasonal locations
	- permanent villages, multi-family lodge houses (2000 people)
	- summer camps
	- midwinter bison hunt camps
-

##### 6.2.3.1. summer village

- circle in two exogamous moieties (Sky and Earth)
- 24 clans in all
	- all had to be represented in settlement, camp, or ritual
- another tripartite division (not sure if it's related)
	- Sky People (7 clans)
	- Earth People (7 clans)
	- Water People (7 clans)
	- Honga (Earth + Water) moietied against Sky
	- over time added 3 more
		- 2 to sky
		- 1 to Honga

###### 6.2.3.1.1. how did summer village come about?

- well, Osage history remembered as "series of constitutional crises in which the elders gradually worked out exactly this arrangement"

![](https://i.imgur.com/LT3Ghna.png)

- the story is kept in pieces by everyone and hidden behind initiation grades
- records of one discussion:
	- life and motion produced by the interaction of two principles: sky and earth, so they divided their society the same way (and exogamously)
- [[Nohozhinga]] are Little Old Men who are the only ones that get past 2nd tier; their whole day is spent philosophizing
	- also 4-7 day spirit quests, basically
	- they were the effective government
	- a theocracy? or "no difference between officials, priests, and philosophers"
		- [???]

###### 6.2.3.1.2. the actual history (and … did Montesquieu get his ideas from an Osage)

- [ • • •]
- "two elements deserve emphasis"
	- 1
		- starts with neutralization of arbitrary power
			- deadly sorcerer given central position in new alliance
			- this story common among descendants of groups affected by Mississippi civilization
		- destructive ritual knowledge distributed to everyone, with checks and balances concerning its use
	- 2
		- even Osage didn't see social structure as coming from on high, but legal and intellectual discoveries or breakthroughs

actual theory shows that it's NOT just European Enlightenment where people self-consciously create their own institutional arrangements

- this kind of thinking commonplace in NA before European settlers even there
- and, conceivably, Montesquieu got his ideas from an Osage and Missouria delegation that came to Paris in 1725

we DO think this because of :

##### 6.2.3.2. Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws

- it's believed he "created modern politics" with this
- his book DOES include distinction between "those who do or don't cultivate the land"

## 7. § in which we return to iroquoia, and consider the political philosophies likely to have been familiar to kandiaronk in his youth (481-492]

we've disproven:

- evolutionary schemes
- no getting out of trap of state formation (Cahokia repercussions)

societies in NA only make sense as "product of a specific political history" (question use of hereditary power, revealed religion, personal freedom, independence of women self-consciously debated; and overall anti-authoritarian direction for 300 years)

- so also disproved:
	- all humans behave in a State of Nature like the way the native americans did (individual liberty, mutual aid, political equality)
	- the way they behaved was just random, and that's what it happened to be like there

however, Lahontan recorded people in Great Lakes, and they weren't directly affected by Mississippian rule

- but, people all over were aware of alternative political possibilities, and saw own social orders as self-conscious creations (Barrier to what Cahokia represented, or the French)

### 7.1. ¶  oral traditions of people who weren't directly ruled by Cahokia (482)

#### 7.1.1. ∆ maybe?

- witches
- giving orders / knowledge of a state
- legends precede contact with US govt

[ • • • i skipped most of the details in here]
- Except for Haudenosaunee (Five Nations / Leave Iroquois) all the groups in Iroquoia basically fell apart by 19th centuryy (1800s), so was unavailable when history started to be written down

[Gayanashagowa](Gayanashagowa.md)
- clearly represents political institutions as "self-conscious human creations"
	- social problems with social solutions
	- problem: relationships => breakdown and cannibalism => winning over people to agree to create formal structure for dispute resolution and peace (even a powerful deformed witch, Adodarhoh)
- and yes, obvi, it's magical
- characters clearly reincarnated from creation myth
	- these names all still exist on living people, since names are passed down like titles
- laws of the Leage "spoken into" belts of wampum

similar to Osage founding story: terrifying witch reincorporated into society, and transformed into peacemaker in the process

difference:

In Gayanashagowa, Adodarhoh is explicitly a ruler with powers of command (giving orders = (as bad as)= eating human flesh)

#tidbit it is an anthropological commonplace that if you want to get a sense of a society’s ultimate values it is best to look at what they consider to be the worst sort of behaviour; and that the best way to get a sense of what they consider to be the worst possible behaviour is by examining ideas about witches. [^9]

let's call it the, uh, [[but these bits about preventing a state emerging were obviously added to the narratives because they had experience with the US government, and weren't there before, so they don't really know about states and aren't self-consciously trying to head them off -- argument]]

a common argument G&W have put up with?

G&W: indigenous institutions of chiefship were designed precisely to prevent danger of states emerging

others: how could they organize against something they'd ever experienced

response (not G&W): the narratives of this all recorded in 19th century, by which time they'd all experienced US government, so that's why, and this element added to narratives later

G&W: unlikely! [ • • •] because, let's talk about witchcraft

#### 7.1.2. when giving orders are ok: witches and dream-guessing

- accusations of witchcraft (or just the possibility) used to keep people from getting to much money or power over others
- also, [Dream-guessing](Dream-guessing.md): you had to give someone what they dreamed about or there were super dire consequences
	- though *explicit* orders were "fiercely resisted"
	- so, dreams treated "as if commands" given by "own soul or greater spirit" (the Creator, other unknown spirit)
	- #why Dreamers could become prophets for short periods; but orders had to be obeyed them
	- horrendous crime to falsify a dream
- summary:
	- complex ideas about unconscious desire (esp to dominate), and the need to "realize" and manage ("keep it under control") that desire
		- image of the witch at the center of this

### 7.2. ¶ (486-490)
- Iroquoian society, in 17th century, "began to take form" around the time as Cahokia's "heyday"
	- [ • • • caveats]
- [Late Owasco](late_owasco.md) phase marks change from previous conditions to living in palisaded towns of up to 2,000 people, primarily in longhouses
