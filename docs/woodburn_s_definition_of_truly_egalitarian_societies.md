# Woodburn's definition of truly egalitarian societies

([James Woodburn](James_Woodburn.md))

- researched societies (forager and nomadic forager societies)
	- [Hadza](east_african_hadza.md)
		- apply "principles of equality" to basically everything
	- [[san_bushmen]]
	- [[mbuti_pygmies]]
	- [[Pandaram]] of south India
	- [[Batek]] of Malaysia
- concludes:
	- they are "the only genuinely egalitarian societies we know of, since they extend equality to gender relations and (as much as practicable) old and young"
	- this behavior based on self-conscious ethos that no one should be in relation of ongoing dependency to anyone else[^2]
		- echoes [Boehm](boehm_christopher.md)'s notion of [actuarial intelligence](actuarial_intelligence.md)
		- but with Woodburn twist: the *real* defining feature of such societies is "the lack of any material surplus"
