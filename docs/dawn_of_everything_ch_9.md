## Teotihuacan

"republican" tradition

highland

- all of this absent
	- few written inscriptions
	- lots of pictorial art
		- no representations of ruler doing anything nasty to a subordinate (unlike maya and zapotec)
		- deliberate inversion of Mesoamerican compositional principles
			- flat composites
			- angular blocks
			- tight fits
		- celebrates community as a whole and its collective values
		- conscious cultural inversion (aka [[schismogenesis]] , according to [Esther Pasztory](Esther_Pasztory.md)
			- new tradition of art created to express difference
			- rejects
				- visual trope of ruler and captive
				- glorification of aristocrats
			- [Teotihuacan](Teotihuacan.md) was utopian experiment in urban life
	- no ceremonial ball-court
	- no great tombs
		- tunnels under [[pyramids_of_the_sun_and_the_moon]], and [[Temple of the Feathered Serpent]] lead to weird other-worlds (labyrinths, shrines) and not sacred ruler graves
