# theory that you have to simplify the world to say something new about it

- "indigenous life" was a lot more interesting
- standard world-historical narratives **destroy our sense of human possibility** by reducing people to stereotypes
- yes, social history does require simplification
	- all human action has all aspects (political, economic, psychosexual)
	- social history pretends, for the sake of argument, that only one thing is going on
	- trying to detect otherwise hidden patterns
	- all real progress involves saying somewhat ridiculous things
	- you have to simplify the world to say something new about it
- but if you continue to simplify "long after the discovery", that's the problem ^[[Dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md) p 22]
	- and this can do the problem, of destroying our sense of human possibility
