# Seasonal or lunar

CK completely misinterprets DoE because he's excited to talk about "the oscillatory principle that we in the [Radical Anthropology Group](http://radicalanthropologygroup.org/) have analysed as the inner secret of hunter-gatherer egalitarianism ever since _Blood Relations_ was published three decades ago"

CK thinks DoE think:

- egalitarianism in one season
- hierarchy in the next
- then egalitarianism again (it's superior)
- yet, these revolutions feel great, even if we have to experience hierarchy
- let's keep doing this, even though we know egalitarianism is superior, just for the feeling
	- involves "allowing ‘special’ individuals to establish dominance so as to present a nice target for the next revolutionary upsurge."

I don't know his model, but the idea is:

- oscillation took place on a monthly schedule ("monthly periodicities [took] precedence over seasonal rhythms")
- if these oscillations involved essentially full social revolutions, this would have been happening monthly, and that's way too often to be realistic
