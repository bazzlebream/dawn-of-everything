## 1. the king
- they definitely had a king, even if historians use other terms ("paramount chief")
- and the Europeans called him ... Carlos ? which etymologically derives from a word meaning free man (*Karl* in Germanic)?
- looked like European king:
	- gold diadem
	- beaded leg bands (?)
	- wooden throne
- king privileges
	- only one allowed to sit on the dope throne
	- "absolute powers"
	- "will was law"
	- could kill people for insubordination
	- secret rituals to renew nature
	- subjects kneeled and raised hands in obeisance
	- accompanied y warrior nobles and priests (ruling elite classes) who did government
	- specialized craftspeople
		- court metallurgists (silver, gold, copper)
- "sacred" or "divine" king, see "ritual at death"

### 1.1. ritual at death
- (of ruler or wife)
- some of subject's sons and daughters (aren't they subjects too?) were kille

## 2. getting stuck
- clearly they were "stuck" in a single economic/political mode with a great deal of inequality
- however, this happened without European-style farming
