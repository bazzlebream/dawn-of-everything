# the pre-enlightenment-societies-were-not-self-conscious argument

pre-enlightenment societies, or so this argument goes, were ‘traditional’ societies, founded on community, status, authority and the sacred. they were societies in which human beings did not ultimately act for themselves, individually or collectively. rather, they were slaves of custom; or, at best, agents of inexorable social forces which they projected on to the cosmos in the form of gods, ancestors or other supernatural powers. supposedly, only modern, post-enlightenment people had the capacity to self-consciously intervene in history and change its course; on this everyone suddenly seemed to agree, no matter how virulently they might disagree about whether it was a good idea to do so.[^1]
