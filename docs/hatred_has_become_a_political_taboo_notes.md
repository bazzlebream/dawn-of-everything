# hatred has become a political taboo notes

[source: Hatred has become a political taboo](hatred_has_become_a_political_taboo.md)

- some hatreds are overcome through solidarity practices
- some hatreds can't be (overcome through solidarity practices)
	- why not?
		- their "fundamental institutional basis"[^3] has to be transformed[^4]

A true [[geography of revolutionary groups ]]would begin[^1] by :
- mapping out the lines _within which_ such webs of hatred [are] actively overcome through practices of solidarity, and 
-  mapping out the lines _across which_ (justifiable) hatreds cannot be overcome without transforming their[^2] fundamental institutional basis—whether those be the organization of workplace, government bureaus, or patriarchal families. 

Once we stop seeing hatred as something to be ashamed of, it will simply become obvious that even the deepest, most personal, hatreds are overcome[^5] within relations of solidarity
- which, in turn, will make it obvious that once those institutional structures are destroyed, no human being will remain beyond redemption.



[^1]: "not imagining groups based on some perfect, idealized solidarity (and then bewailing the fact that they don’t really exist), but rather, "
[^2]: the "lines" or the "hatreds"?
[^3]: "the organization of workplace, government bureaus, or patriarchal families", etc.
[^4]: (first and/or in tandem with overcoming (transforming?) the hatred too)?
[^5]: What does "overcome" mean in this sense? Like, the solidarity ... "contains" in the sense of keeping it from manifesting?
