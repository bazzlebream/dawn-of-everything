# Agricultural Argument of 19th century jurists
- legal basis for dispossessing people who lived where Europeans wanted to live or use
- "played major role in displacement of thousands of indigenous peoples" and "the destruction of entire civilizations"

how it worked:
- assert that foraging people living in [[State of Nature]]
	- that is, they were "part of the land but had no legal claims to own it"
- displacement based on claim that inhabitants weren't "really" working
	- where does this idea come from?
	- [John Locke's Second Treatise of Government (1690)](john_locke_s_second_treatise_of_government_1690.md)] (property rights come from working the land)
	- [Lockeans](Lockeans.md) say:
		- "lazy" natives aren't working the land or improving it
		- they are just using it for basic needs with little effort
- [James Tully](james_tully.md) explains:
	- so, land used for hunting and gathering considered "vacant"
	- if the indigenous people try to invoke their laws or claim property, it wasn't really theirs to begin with, so the Europeans said they could murder them since they are violating "natural law"

## 1. criticisms (to put it mildly)

### 1.1. from indigenous legal scholars
- it's claim that there's only one way to care for and improve land (in its case, European-style farming) is wrong
	- there are many ways to care for it
	- those ways are so different to Europeans that the methods and results aren't even noticed[^1]
	- those ways can be very labor-intensive (ie are "work" in the "hard work" sense)
	- those ways are governed by indigenous laws
		- laws govern "differential access to resources", even
	- calling it "foraging" is a misnomer, and it should be referred to as a totally different kind of farming
- so-called private property rights:
	- not the same sense as Roman Law or English Common Law
	- however, self-evident that they have some conception of property rights; the conception of property was just different
		- "extraordinarily complex and sophisticated conceptions of ownership"
		- sometimes, even, differential access to resources (and that sometimes resulted in emergence of social classes)

[^1]: > What to a settlerâ€™s eye seemed savage, untouched wilderness usually turns out to be landscapes actively managed by indigenous populations for thousands of years through controlled burning, weeding, coppicing, fertilizing and pruning, terracing estuarine plots to extend the habitat of particular wild flora, building clam gardens in intertidal zones to enhance the reproduction of shellfish, creating weirs to catch salmon, bass and sturgeon, and so on.
