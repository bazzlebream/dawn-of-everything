# “IN WHICH WE FINALLY RETURN TO THE QUESTION OF PROPERTY, AND INQUIRE AS TO ITS RELATION TO THE SACRED”

p 155

(moving towards private property)

- a miniature kingdom is  **not inevitable** as soon as a society is capable of stockpiling a surplus

- **look at Natchez**
	- monarch's power was unlimited, but only where he was present
	- outside the royal village it was laugh-the-authorities-out-of-town kind of thing
	- so something "precisely in between" pure empty theatre and court of Suleiman the Magnificent

- you know “the prevailing view that human beings lived more or less like Kalahari Bushmen, until the invention of agriculture sent everything askew”
- well, that's now disproven
	- **agriculture not necessary for non-[immediate return hunter-gatherers](immediate%20return%20hunter-gatherers)**
		- Pleistocene mammoth hunters
		- period following glacial retreat
			- new societies form on resource-rich areas
			- gather in large, permanent settlements
	- **surplus doesn't inevitably lead to hierarchy**
		- many of these societies *could* have supported royal courts and standing armies, but almost certainly didn't
		- to prove they could:
			- Poverty Point earthworks
			- Jomon sites

**turningi to ownership**
- however, we can't say what "ownershp" looked like in these societies
	- we can say that these places were in some sense "sacred places"
	- this tells us a lot about "origins" of "private property"
	- [p 163 concluding para] impossible to know which forms of property or ownership

[James Woodburn](James%20Woodburn.md)

- rule in these [immediate return hunter-gatherers](immediate%20return%20hunter-gatherers): no adult should give orders to another
- an exception: in the sphere of ritual / the sacred
	- example: Hadza religion, gender initiation cults: exclusive claims to ownership (ritual privileges) (Intellectual Property lol)
	- protected by secrecy, deception, threat of violence
	- **sacred items:** complex games of secrets
		- often only important, explusive forms of property in which autonomy is paramount value ([[free societies]])
- so confined to sacred contexts:
	- relations of command
	- absolute (an old term) aka private (modern term) property
	- *in these societies*, a formal similarity “between the notion of private property and the notion of the sacred. Both are, essentially, structures of exclusion.”

absolute

_Law_. Of property, a title, etc.: owned or held outright, unconditionally, or with a guarantee by the state that no one has a better right to it; owned as an estate in fee simple. Of a person: owning property in this way.In modern British use, _absolute title_ is a form of title which, when registered under the Land Registration Act (1925/2002) gives the registered person the strongest form of ownership of the registered freehold or leasehold interest.
1708 _Rastell's Termes de la Ley_ (new ed.) at _Property_ There are three manner of rights of Property; that is, Property absolute, Property qualified, and Property possessory.

- also implicit in:
[[Emile Durkheim’s classic definition of the sacred]]
- as "set apart", literally and figuratively
	- because of *connection with higher force or being*
- clearest expression of sacred was "tabu" (lit 'not to be touched')

**formal similarity**

so, “But when we speak of absolute, private property, are we not talking about something very similar – almost identical in fact, in its underlying logic and social effects?”

- logic
- social effects

British legal theorists

- individual property rights held "Against the whole world"
- DoE: object is set apart, fenced about, but not because it's *tied to some supernatural being*, but because it's "sacred" to a specific living human being
	- (so, the specific person takes the place of the Durkheim's "higher force or being" in DoE's words)

this parallel leads to: weird European social thought ([[possessive individualism]])

- this absolute, sacred quality in private property as a paradigm for all human rights and freedoms
	- you "own" your body and legally can exclude others
- (unlike [free societies](free%20societies))

consequences:

- those who didn't share this conception of the sacred (now mapped onto individuals) could be killed, tortured, or imprisoned

*mostly in the world, owning means nurturing, too; except in roman law where owning just means being able to destroy it (and the caring part is eliminated)*

- Native American societies mostly found this an alien way of looking at things
- however, when it did apply, it was to sacred objects (or [Robert Lowie's term 'sacra'](Robert%20Lowie%20sacra.md)), which were "individually owned and jealously guarded"

so [^1]

??
- often sacra have material and immaterial elements, like a feast-dish that lets you gather berries in a certain area, and the right to present those berries at a feast[^2]
- true "owners" of land were gods or spirits
- ownership and mastery are always the same word in Amazonia
	- these attitudes (predatory or caretaker) coexist sometimes *precisely at the point where violence appropriation of the natural world turns into nurture*
	- ethnographers note that in Amazonia ownership is always domination and care
	- totemic systems have extreme form of "care", human clans "own" animal species, but it means they can't hunt, kill, harm, or consume those anmals -- they have to make them flourish

(back to Roman Law (and this almost all modern legal systems) notion of property)
- unique in that the responsibility to "care and share" is reduced to minimum or eliminated entirely
- 3 rights to possession: 
	- usus (use)
	- fructure (enjoy products)
	- abusus (damage or destroy)
	- first 2 are usufruct, and that's *not considered true possession under the law*
	- defining feature is that option of destroying it or not taking care of it

looking towards: conclusion about coming of private property

[[initiation rituals of Australian Western Desert]]
- guardians of territories
- sacra (churinga, tsurinja) : relics of ancestors (wood or stone)
	- also can embody legal title to lands
	- [Durkheim_emile](Durkheim_emile.md) considered archetype of sacred (things set apart and accorded pious devotion)
- new cohorts taught about land
- charged with caring for it
	- duty to maintain churinga and sacred sites (only initiated know about)
	- [[T G H Strehlow]]: weight of duty conveyed through terror, torture, mutilation

theme: [[behavior in ritual contexts takes exactly the opposite form to the free and equal relations that prevail in ordinary life]]
- only within such contexts that exclusive (sacred) forms of property exist, "strict and top-down hierarchies are enforced, and orders given are dutifully obeyed"

suggest:
- carefully co-ordinated ritual theatres (geometric precision) were kinds of places where exclusive claims to property rights (and obedience) were made, among "otherwise [free people](free%20societies)"
- (implied) but here (logical similarities of privae property and sacred) it's circumscribed in one area
- big question: how did it order **so many other** aspects of human affairs


[^1]: so we really have 3-fold
     sacred to force
	 sacred object to person
	 private property to person
[^2]: “Walens 1981: 56–8 provides an elaborate analysis of Kwakiutl feast dishes, which are both corporeal and incorporeal property at the same time since they can die and be reincarnated.”
