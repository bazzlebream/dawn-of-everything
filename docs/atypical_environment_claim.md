# atypical environment claim (to prop up the Agricultural Revolution myth)
- to write off people like the [Calusa](calusa.md)
	- "evolutionary quirks or anomalies"

- the claim:
	- they only behaved like they did because they lived in "atypical" environments
	- "atypical" usually means:
		- wetlands (coasts, river valleys)
		- NOT marginal areas (desert margins, corners of tropical forests)
- the premise:
	- hunter-gatherers really should (have been) living in marginal areas since that's where they live today

## 1. criticism
- in the 1900-1950s, anyone doing foraging (hunting, gathering wild food) was living on land no one else wanted
	- Kalahari Desert
	- Arctic Circle
- however, 10kya this was not the case
	- everyone was a forager
	- low population densities
	- foragers could live wherever they wanted
	- so they went where wild resources were abundant
