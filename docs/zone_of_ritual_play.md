# Zone of ritual play

gardens of adonis’ are a fitting symbol here. knowledge about the nutritious properties and growth cycles of what would later become staple crops, feeding vast populations – wheat, rice, corn – was initially maintained through ritual play farming of exactly this sort. nor was this pattern of discovery limited to crops. ceramics were first invented, long before the neolithic, to make figurines, miniature models of animals and other subjects, and only later cooking and storage vessels. mining is first attested as a way of obtaining minerals to be used as pigments, with the extraction of metals for industrial use coming only much later. mesoamerican societies never employed wheeled transport; but we know they were familiar with spokes, wheels and axles since they made toy versions of them for children. greek scientists famously came up with the principle of the steam engine, but only employed it to make temple doors that appeared to open of their own accord, or similar theatrical illusions. chinese scientists, equally famously, first employed gunpowder for fireworks.[^1]

history as a continual series of new ideas and innovations, technical or otherwise, during which different communities made collective decisions about which technologies they saw fit to apply to everyday purposes, and which to keep confined to the domain of experimentation or ritual play. what is true of technological creativity is, of course, **even more true of social creativity**. one of the most striking patterns we discovered while researching this book – indeed, one of the patterns that felt most like a genuine breakthrough to us – was how, time and again in human history, **that zone of ritual play has also acted as a site of social experimentation – even, in some ways, as an encyclopaedia of social possibilities**.

- the concept of "refugia" (pl; "refugium", sg) seems to be apropos here
