# Dawn of Everything: Ch 2: Wicked Liberty (summary)

## 1. terms and concepts

### 1.1. autonomy

- radical autonomy
- not being told what to do + mutual aid

### 1.2. myth of "the myth of the noble savage"
- there was never a "noble savage" myth among European travelers (in the sense of the stereotype of simple societies living in age of happy primordial innocence)
	- instead, the Europeans were ambivalent (alien societies were complicated, mixes of bad and good)
- racist Europeans in 1859 concocted a story that Rousseau employed the term and concept "noble savage"

### 1.3. myth of the stupid (blissful) savage
- What Rousseau did promote was the "stupid (blissful) savage" myth

## 2. Main themes

### 2.1. Which parts of indigenous critique were most shocking to Europeans

### 2.2. how the actual question "origin of inequality" came about

- Backwater of Europe, characterized by:
	- not thinking of equality as self-conscious paramount value
	- barely thinking equality as a concept at all
	- there were models, but doesn't explain how it became :
		- assumption of "simple humans"
		- talked about as self-conscious value around which to organize society
- Backwater (Jesuits):
	- autonomy, liberty actually bad (even formally): animalistic, "opposed to freedom in principle"
- Backwater (Portugal and Spain) meets New World and Indian Ocean
	- intellectuals exposed to new ideas
- Combo
	- Indigenous Critique
		- stage 1: French society generally blows; french are basically slaves
		- stage 2: focused on liberty and mutual aid (aka freedom and communism) (autonomy,)
			- *only over time* did "no one's will subordinated to another" become talking about "equality"
			- communism terms
				- property regime
				- baseline communism
		- stage 3: organization of private property / translating wealth into power
		- stage 4: articulation of equality?
			- only after Americans go to Paris and compare directly
			- schismogenesis

going backwards

- philosophers can look at people in "the raw" rather than as "degenerated"
- <-- state of nature
- state of nature
- <-- by natural law theorists focusing on simple societies
- simple societies
- <--
- <-- earlier
	- <-- people without civilization were "Degenerated" aka "fallen"; all knowledge dispensed by God at the beginning of time, so everyone used to have the info and no longer did, and these societies had clearly lost it the most
	- <-- history not stages (progress) but disasters

### 2.3. problems with definitions of equality

- One of the issues with the question "what are the origins of inequality" is the definition of "equality". (This also means there is no agreed-upon meaning for "egalitarian")
	- They conclude that "equality" and "egalitarian", as they have been used, refer to a state or condition of people "without the tokens of inequality" or "without the trappings of civilization".[^1]
	- In other words, they are default terms (terms used as a catchall).
	- This means that, in practice, the terms refer to something like a "protoplasmic mass of humanity" or "primordial human soup".[^2]
	- Among other things, when the terms are used this way, they are not helpful in analysis of human prehistory and tell us almost nothing about the societies they are used to describe. (They do not have "analytical substance".)
- Furthermore, "self-conscious ideas of ‘equality’, putting equality forward as an explicit value (as opposed to an ideology of freedom, or dignity, or participation that applies equally to all) appear to have been relative latecomers to human history."[^3]

### 2.4. problems with engaging with indigenous sources: Western arrogance & critiques

G&W's assumption in interpreting conversations between "European colonists" and their "indigenous interlocutors": "all parties to the conversation between […] were adults, and that, at least occasionally, they actually listened to each other."

This is in contrast to two major tactics (ie. "Western arrogance") scholars take to avoid "engaging" with indigenous sources or "pushing them" "into a conceptual space where their judgements no longer seemed threatening".[^7]

- Great-Man arrogance[^9]
	- Historians often[^4] use the [Great Man theory of history](great_man_theory_of_history.md) and consequently discount indigenous viewpoints, even when the "Great Man" in question explicitly say they are getting their ideas from those indigenous sources.[^5]
- Infantilization of indigenous people and sources arrogance:
	- "Europeans […] claimed that accounts of these encounters had a profound influence on their thinking. To deny any possibility that they were right is, effectively, to insist that indigenous people could not possibly have any real impact on history. It is, in fact, a way of infantilizing non-Westerners.""
- Other-ize indigenous people and sources arrogance aka "saying the Other was unknowable to the source"
	- "Indigenous people are assumed to have lived in a completely different universe, inhabited a different reality, even; anything Europeans said about them was simply a shadow-play projection, fantasies of the ‘noble savage’ culled from the European tradition itself."[^6]
- "Other-ize-ing is actually a critique" arrogance[^8] aka "saying the Other is unknowable because the source is racist"
	- Here I'm paraphrasing an example of this type of argument, rather than, as in above examples, presenting G&W's thoughts about the argument itself; the "arrogance" is, as G&W clarify later, also about "letting oneself off the hook":
	- Genocidal imperialists were certainly not listening to the people they were mass murdering. (That is, they were interested in murder, not comprehending, so anything they would have heard would have been heard as though coming from a completely alien source.)

### 2.5. book's project (mark 2)

- They are still interested in writing about the history of the "trappings of civilization", but:
	- will be using a different definition of civilization

[^1]: Such things as princes, judges, overseers, priests, cities, writing, farming.
[^2]: G&W do say that there's usually some "baseline equality" at work, but they are careful to differentiate their characterization of this "baseline equality" (eg. "all equally powerless in the face of the gods") from the way it's used nowadays, which is both recent ()
[^3]: p 77
[^4]: Knowingly or unknowingly.
[^5]: They offer the case of [Leibniz](gottfried_wilhelm_leibniz.md) admitting his ideas about statecraft were cribbed from Chinese models.
[^6]: p 30
[^7]: p 73
[^8]: "To say Mi’kmaq thought is unimportant would be racist; to say it’s unknowable because the sources were racist, however, does rather let one off the hook" p 72
[^9]: #todo Could use some work adding (i) paraphrase of arrogance (ii) why G&W think it's bad
