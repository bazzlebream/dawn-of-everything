# comments on scale or social worlds

comments on "scale" or "social worlds"

- advanced in technology make the world "smaller" in the sense that it's practically easier for people to move[^1]
- the major trend historically has been for the size of social worlds to shrink
	- increases in the number of people correlate with fewer people (relatively) actually travelling
		- as the number of people goes up, the "scale" of social relations shrinks
	- what once were non-discrete societies become increasingly differentiated
		- the general historical trend
		- exception: very recently, during "globalization"
