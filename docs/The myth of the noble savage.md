# The myth of the noble savage (2001)

This book is impossible to read; it literally makes things even more confusing. 

- "The Myth of the Noble Savage"
	- (claims to) critique and offer an exposé of another "myth", the existence of Savages who were really noble

- The (supposed) exposé: (what is the "critique" part here?)
	- asserts that 
		- the "myth" of savage nobility was created in the 18th century by [Rousseau](jean-jaques_rousseau.md) as part of a romantic glorification of the "savage" to serve as a paradigmatic counterexample for constructing attacks on European society
		- that myth has been widespread ever since

## 1. construction
- deliberate mythological **construction**:
	- the critique and expose
	- ie the "false claim of widespread belief in the existence of the "Noble Savage" inspired by Rousseau"
	- "the claim of the reality of belief in the Noble Savage" (is part of the construction of the myth itself)[^1]

- this book:
	- Rousseau did not create the "myth of the noble savage" (?)
	- who did? the racists

- crazy strategies
	- any attempt to find a substantive basis for "belief in the Noble Savage" plays the game defined by the construction's own rules
