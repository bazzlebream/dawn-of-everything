# Hobbesian trap

[Steven Pinker](steven_pinker.md)'s term for:
- individuals in tribal societies are constantly either raiding or engaged in warfare, live hazardous and desperate lives, and are always on the edge of death by violence.
- this is the fate evolution has in store for us
- it's only been avoided by setting up nation states, courts, and police which protect us from ourselves
	- oh and also debate and self-control
	- (Pinker associates this and  our current ideals of freedom, equality and democracy with exclusively-European "civilizing process" that led to [Age of Enlightenment](age_of_enlightenment.md)

## 1. counterarguments
- it essentially is saying: "all significant forms of human progress before the twentieth century can be attributed only to that one group of humans who used to refer to themselves as ‘the white race’ (and now, generally, call themselves by its more accepted synonym, ‘Western civilization’)"^[p 17]
- most Europeans, including [Enlightenment](age_of_enlightenment.md) thinkers, would have been opposed to "democracy"[^opposeddemocracy] and, in fact, attributed arguments in favor of such to foreigners^[qv. [indigenous critique](indigenous_critique.md)]

[^opposeddemocracy]:  > The idea that our current ideals of freedom, equality and democracy are somehow products of the ‘Western tradition’ would in fact have come as an enormous surprise to someone like Voltaire. As we’ll soon see, the Enlightenment thinkers who propounded such ideals almost invariably put them in the mouths of foreigners, even ‘savages’ like the Yanomami. This is hardly surprising, since it’s almost impossible to find a single author in that Western tradition, from Plato to Marcus Aurelius to Erasmus, who did not make it clear that they would have been opposed to such ideas. The word ‘democracy’ might have been invented in Europe (barely, since Greece at the time was much closer culturally to North Africa and the Middle East than it was to, say, England), but it’s almost impossible to find a single European author before the nineteenth century who suggested it would be anything other than a terrible form of government.
