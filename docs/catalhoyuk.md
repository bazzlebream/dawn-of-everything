# Çatalhöyük

> Located on the Konya Plain of central Turkey, Çatalhöyük was first settled around 7400 bc, and continued to be populated for some 1,500 years (for the purposes of mental calibration, roughly the same period of time that separates us from [Amalafrida, Queen of the Vandals](amalafrida_queen_of_the_vandals.md), who reached the height of her influence around ad 523). The site’s renown derives partly from its surprising scale. At thirteen hectares, it was more town than village, with a population of some 5,000. Yet it was a town with no apparent centre or communal facilities, or even streets: just a dense agglomeration of one household after another, all of similar sizes and layout, each accessed by ladder from the roof.[^1]
