# Dawn of Everything: Ch 6: Gardens of Adonis (notes)

- [The dawn of everything: ch 6](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md)

- going to be talking about origins of farming
- "play farming": [gardens of Adonis women's cult](gardens_of_adonis_women_s_cult.md)
- "serious farming": [[Demeter]] and [Thesmophoria](thesmophoria.md)
- agriculture 8,000 years before Plato in Neolithic

## 1. One-paragraph summary

The "You can skip this chapter bit": We're trying to figure out how we got stuck with violent domination. The Standard Narrative posits that top-down hierarchies and violent domination were the inevitable result of people beginning to farm To the contrary, in this chapter we establish that some of the places where farming was adopted had little if any violent domination. So why is our situation characterized by the top-down hierarchies and violent domination, and why do we seem to be stuck in that situation?

## 2. What idea(s) embody the spirit of the first agriculturalists?

(p 241) Less an economic transition then a "media revolution", "social revolution", encompassing uh basically all aspects of society. Women's work and knowledge were central; it was fairly leisurely, even playful, not forced, unmarked by major violent conflict (See the "not a break" thing in  • • • Full Circle?); and radical inequality extremely unlikely as outcome
- and this no "switch" from "Paleolithic forager" to "Neolithic farmer" - took 3,000 years
	- agriculture (among many other things) allowed for possibility of wealth inequal concentrations, but that took place only thousands of years after it first showed up
		- play-farming in between
- process of length and complexity can't be called Agricultural Revolution
- and doesn't explain origins of social rank, inequality, private property
- and it was the people who didn't farm who did violence and ranks

(Are we going for, like "parity of men and women", "no ranks", "elder women important", "definitely not agricultural rituals", "standard housing plans with individual difference") ?

- look at [Çatalhöyük](catalhoyuk.md) (7400 bc - 5900 bc)
	- identical outsides of houses
	- wild, macabre, individual interiors

- intellectual history
	- 1960s excavations, scholars who see it as monument to origins of farming ("serious farming")
		- aka started the [Agricultural Revolution](agricultural_revolution.md)
	- 1990s techniques, play farming

- phat lady sculptures not fertility goddesses
- "primitive matriarchies" and intense politicization
	- Victorian fantaties
	- imagined confrontation at border Neolithic/ Bronze Age
		- Matilda Joslyn Gage: Woman, Church, and State (1893)
			- Matriarchate
		- Otto Gross
			- came up with "collective unconscious", which Carl Jung ripped off
			- and introversion / extroversion
		- Nazis
	- "no go" topic because of politicization
		- exponents written out of history
	- why?
		- backlash against [Marija Gimbutas](marija_gimbutas.md)
			- her argument, two parts:
				- grasslands people invade Europe, (bringing patriarchy)
				- early neolithic societies relatively free of ranks and hierarchies
			- because she's been written out of history, for some reason people can't even think about how **hierarchy and exploitation took root in the domestic sphere** (unless invoking Rousseau and the idea that farming automatically did it)
			- her plan: explain [Old Europe](maria_gimbutas_notion_of_old_europe.md)
				- vs the kurgan folk
			- her view different from Victorian Fantasies of the clash
				- women's autonomy and ritual priority in Neolithic in middle east and Europe
				- 1990s: ecofeminism
				- views got popular
			- accused of being popular
				- really, though, seen to be meddling in man-game

- (first part of argument) what is true about Gimbutas account, from DNA evidence now
	- herding people from grasslands north of Black Sea around 3rd millennium bc
		- maybe even massive migrations from European steppe, population replacement, spread of Indo-European languages
	- so people are now talking about her stuff again
- (second part of argument - early neolithic societies relatively free of ranks and hierarchies)
	- gaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

SEE: [[establish def of "matriarchy" That allows us to say it can't be excluded that it existed in time she's talking about]] pp 219-220

- female form in Çatalhöyük in ritual/art/images
	- special focus
	- lots of weird ones
- so, the figurines probably not all one thing
	- one possible thing: matriarchs / interest in female elders
		- no equivalent male elder representations
	- possible this doesn't mean anything
		- female inhabitants from diet and health perspective are same standard of living as men
		- ritual treatment in death of male/female also similar
	- males only see an equivalent "all them" representation in the wall decorations of hunting

1990s techniques
- household organization reverberates through all aspects of social life
	- no central authority (despite large "scale")
	- rules learned within house itself
		- ceremonies
		- micro-routines
	- no signs of ranking divisions

high value on routine

- well, with houses: same organization for up to 1000 years, even down to position of ovens and bins
- and ritual images and installations, kind of

#theme #egalitarian

was it "egalitarian"?

- not self-consciously that can be told
- but also no sigins of rank
	- however, houses did accumulate prestige over time
		- density of certain things
		- ? b/c elders were important, esp elder women?
- prestigious and un-prestigious houses mixed among one another; no "elite neighborhoods"
- symmetrical or complementary gender relations
	- art themes
	- maybe even kept apart?

- no reference to agriculture through all of this art and ritual
	- even tho domestic cereals and domestic livestock more nutritionally important than wild stuff
	- yet for 1000 years, just see hunting and foraging images and ritual

**The gaps in our knowledge can probably be explained by seasonal variations of social structure**
- since we have a lot of gaps in knowledge; only 5% is excavated, where are gaps
	- surroundings
		- wetlands / surrounded by swamps most of the year, with raised areas of dry land in places
		- winters cold and damp
		- summers very hot (and i assume humid)
		- spring to autumn: sheep and goats move around pastre areas in plains, and maybe highlands
		- arable crops sown late in spring on [receding floodplain](receding_floodplains.md) of the [carsamba](carsamba.md).
		- harvesting and processing in late summer
		- quick ripening - season of Adonis
	- we might be seeing only the winter arrangements in the built environment (ie [[seasonal variations of social structure]])
		- (hunting and veneration of dead)
		- social reality shrinks back towards houses
	- there might have been a totally other arrangement in summer / figuratively "on the rooftops"
- maybe why town endured too
	- material equality in day-to-day
	- hierarchy developed much more slowly (rituals joining living to dead)
		- (zw: we'll see this later with rulers becoming dead and killing people)
		- domestication stuff (shepherding and cultivation) involved division of labor, most likely
			- but, that hierarchy at least wasn't represented in ceremonial life of household

- now looking at where they planted crops
	- going back to floodplain assertion from before (rather than dry-land arable fields, which were too far away)

(bit about catalhoyuk not adopting domestic cattle or pigs because of the hunting prestige of the wild versions)

SEE [Fertile Crescent](fertile_crescent.md) for information on how it got named.

## 3. difference between uplanders and lowlanders

### 3.1. lowlanders

#### 3.1.1. looking at domestication "from perspective of wheat" is misleading; it's actually scientific (human, probably mostly women) achievements, and writing it from POV of wheat erases women
- keep in mind how they want to (re)define argiculture, domestication, cultivate, and what the current definitions hide or change, botany, gardening, ecology
##### 3.1.1.1. process of domestication (keep term "cultivation" in mind)
###### 3.1.1.1.1. not from POV of wheat, from POV of humans
###### 3.1.1.1.2. humans, focusing on wheat and barley
##### 3.1.1.2. what does cultivation mean
###### 3.1.1.2.1. flood retreat farming
##### 3.1.1.3. what was the real ecological system like

### 3.2. uplanders (p 241-244)

## 4. bringing it together (p 244)
- schismogenesis

## 5. old edifice of human (social) evolution collapsing
- foragers and farming did (at the time) be logical opposites
	- foragers with shared features of farmers called incipient, emergent, or deviant
