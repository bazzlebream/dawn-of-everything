# Turgot's stages of economic development / (theory of social evolution)

- social evolution begins with hunters
- then to pastoralism
- then farming
- only then to urban commercial civilization

- anyone we find in one of the older ones are "vestiges" of previous stages of development

- lays basis for theories of social evolution
