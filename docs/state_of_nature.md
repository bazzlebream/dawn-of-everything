# State of Nature
> the State of Nature had already been used in European philosophy for a century [before Rousseau's Discourse]. Widely deployed by natural law theorists, it effectively allowed every thinker interested in the origins of government (Locke, Grotius and so on) to play God, each coming up with his own variant on humanityâ€™s original condition, as a springboard for speculation.^[[Dawn of everything](dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.md) p 12]

- "minimal sense of a default state that might be shared by societies which they saw as lacking government, writing, religion, private property or other significant means of distinguishing themselves from one another. ^[p 46]
