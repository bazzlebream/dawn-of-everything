That is, increases in scale (in area, population, or density) do not set off chain reactions which inevitably lead to the formation of states. Many forms of organization other than top-down hierarchy are historically common in long-lived and thriving urban situations.</p><p><strong>Human cognitive capacities and attested living patterns are commensurate with living in highly populated urban areas. In other words, cities are possible, and their mere existence doesn&#39;t require explanation just because of their size or complexity.</strong></p><p>Humans are cognitively capable of at least two distinct modes of interpersonal interaction:</p><ol><li>The way you relate to your friends and family, and places, that you know directly.</li><li>The way you think of &quot;imaginary&quot; social units such as empires or cities, which exist largely &quot;in our heads&quot;.</li></ol><p>The capacity to live within imaginary social units is what makes it possible to say that &quot;small <strong>groups</strong> of humans&quot; simultaneously live in &quot;large-scale <strong>societies</strong>&quot;, an idea which will be developed below.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at the concept of &quot;scale&quot;. Arguments which invoke &quot;scale&quot; separate associations of humans into &quot;groups&quot; and &quot;societies&quot;. According to that view, foragers live in small-scale groups only. However, the authors posit that foragers also, and at the same time, live in large-scale societies. That this is true is attested by cognitive science, through which we know that humans can live within large &quot;imaginary structures&quot; as well as living at more intimate scales. It is also attested by the archaeological and anthropological findings which show that forager kin groups live with very few biological kin, and that individuals regularly expect to find welcome across vast territories from people they&#39;ve never met and in some cases don&#39;t even share a language with.</p><p><strong>Before we get too into the weeds, let&#39;s consider some answers to the question: Why did cities first arise. We can break this question into two parts:</strong></p><p><em>Why did so many people end up in the same place?</em></p><ol><li>Environmental disasters push people together, such as at Teotihuacan.</li><li>Stable deltaic environments, due to environmental changes at the turn of the Holocene (~11,500 bc), attract large populations.[^1]</li><li>The formation of very fertile &quot;black soil&quot; (Russian: <em>chernozem</em>), such as exists in Ukraine,[^2] also attracted groups.</li></ol><p><em>Once cities formed, how did they stay together?</em></p><ol><li>They were physical realizations of preexisting (and, in part, imaginary) extended communities, such as with the Ukraine &quot;mega-sites&quot;[^3] and the Cucuteni-Tripolyte culture.</li><li>Eco-consciousness: a conscious attempt to nurture and maintain the rich ecologies they settled in.</li><li>Civic festivals created moments when imaginary structures temporarily became tangible and material.</li><li>A united devotion to consciously chosen values.</li><li>Egalitarian structures of government.</li><li>Through the process of making complex decisions.[^4]</li></ol><p><strong>Often the terms &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot; are used to imply that something is not difficult, sophisticated, or requiring of self-conscious thought, reflection, and decisions. We would like to illustrate what is actually going on in these &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;primitive&quot; cases, as well as the terms &quot;uniformity&quot; and &quot;egalitarian&quot;.</strong></p><p>People wishing to discount examples of what we would consider &quot;complex&quot; situations often call these same situations &quot;primitive&quot; or refer to their &quot;simplicity&quot;. Well this &quot;perceived simplicity&quot; really just mislabels certain types of complexity; for instance: logistical, interpersonal, mutual aid, food production and distribution, long-distance trade, mineral extraction, ceramic creation, avoiding ecological collapse despite population size, time-sensitive activities, and corvée-type public projects.</p><p>Sometimes even &quot;uniformity&quot; is taken to be &quot;simple&quot;. One good example is uniformity in housing, neighborhood, and district blueprints. However, housing uniformities are, in the examples we show, actually evidence of complexity: &quot;conceptual frameworks&quot; were shared and expressed even in local decision-making, and did not require a top-down imposition of housing plans, for instance. These conceptual frameworks could be as broad as &quot;entire cosmologies&quot;, such as for inhabitants of Sainte-Engrâce (Basque), who model many of their complex activities on the mathematical constraints of rotating circles.</p><p>Just as perceived simplicity is not actual simplicity, egalitarianism is not simple. Examples include the complex logistics of diverse food and materials products, maintaining surpluses without warfare, the complex housing arrangements we saw above, scheduling duties and events when everyone has cross-cutting obligations, and intricate networks of mutual aid.</p><p>Similar to the ways that &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;egalitarian&quot; are misapplied, scholars use the term &quot;primitive democracy&quot; dismissively to refer to a state of affairs that is in reality characterized by labor mobilization, rulers answerable to town councils, occasional uprisings, and women being included in politics.</p><p><strong>Now that we&#39;ve got a handle on what the standard narrative means by certain terms, let&#39;s look at some examples of <em>cities before they had rulers</em>. (At the same time, we will define three different political structures, and three different egalitarian ethos which map to each one.)</strong></p><p>The Sumerian culture (discovered archaeologically beneath the classic Mesopotamian cities, and chronologically preceding those cities) exhibits evidence of cities, but no signs of monarchy or rulers.[^5] One good example of a specific Sumerian institution that predated monarchy is the town councils, or &quot;district councils and assemblies of elders&quot;. These existed up until the Early Dynastic period in Mesopotamia and over a broad geographic range; in other words, were are a persistent, reliable, and widespread element, rather than a &quot;primitive&quot; element, and they weren&#39;t created by benevolent rulers. In fact, historically, urbanites didn&#39;t need rulers: they created autonomous self-governing units which could, and often did, drive out rulers or, if need be, abandon the city.</p><p>So far we&#39;ve only defined egalitarianism &quot;negatively&quot;.[^6] In other words, we still don&#39;t know what government really looked like before kingship showed up. We&#39;re going to look at Uruk for the answer to that. We have a good idea of what Uruk looked like before royal rule started; that is, before 3200 bc. With that knowledge we will be able to describe what government was like before the appearance of kingship, in Mesopotamian cities.</p><p>A provisional description (of the nature of government before rulers) is that, at least in Uruk, there existed a separate, raised temple sector, whose labor source included the needy, which produced standardized goods (consistently packaged and labeled) within factory-like facilities. The ultimate goal was to provide for the gods and goddesses of the city. This standardization was in contrast to the idiosyncratic productions of individuals, who built and maintained the irrigation systems, roads, and embankments.[^7]</p><p>Because Uruk developed in this way, it happens that another way of life developed too. Uruk had colonial pretensions, and expanded and tried to impose its administrative-commercial-standardization ethos on others along its trade routes. The recipients of this colonialism consciously rejected it through, among other things, creating an inverse social structure.[^8] This structure they created in opposition looks like a &quot;heroic society&quot;: think Beowulf, the Celtic kings, the Maori, or the 19th century Pacific Northwest Coast.</p><p>For a moment, let&#39;s think of Uruk as representing bureaucracy, and the heroic societies representing &quot;politics&quot;, or battles between charismatic elites. In contrast to both of these, in the Indus valley, a thousand years before the caste system (<em>varna</em>), there was a different system. This system was a hierarchical division of social functions along an ascending scale of purity (where purity was higher than commerce), but which lacked the &quot;charismatic authority figures&quot; of the heroic societies that were developing (that is, no warrior aristocracy or heroic accumulation).</p><p>We have seen that it&#39;s possible for egalitarian practices to exist alongside the standardization-bureaucracy-administration urban organization. It is also possible (and even likely) that egalitarian practical mechanisms of local government can exist within this Indus valley-style hierarchy of social orders. Though we don&#39;t have a good example from that time period, we can point to Bali&#39;s current <em>seka</em> system. As an added bonus, the seka&#39;s egalitarian mechanisms (existing alongside the social order hierarchy) are responsible for agriculture that&#39;s feeding a dense population (illustrating that agriculture doesn&#39;t have to be associated with governance hierarchy either).</p><p>At this point we can take a moment for a more theoretical observation: <strong>Given the general notion of an egalitarian ethos, there are three ways it can be expressed (aka &quot;modalities&quot;). They are:</strong></p><ol><li>Everyone is precisely the same, in ways we consider important (like Uruk).</li><li>Everyone is so utterly different that there&#39;s no criteria for comparison (like the Ukranian megasites).</li><li>Rigorous equality in certain areas, with explicit hierarchy elsewhere (like the Indus valley).</li></ol><p>To reiterate our point: <strong>scale (area, population, density) and city-style life don&#39;t lead to states automatically; cities can lead to (and be made possible by) egalitarianism.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, what we&#39;ve been showing seems to imply that even if things start not-authoritarian, they end up going authoritarian. Fortunately, examples from China, Mesoamerica, and Teotihuacan show that it&#39;s possible to go from authoritarian to non-authoritarian as well. These examples will be illustrated next in chapter 9.</p><p>[^1]: Examples provided in this chapter include Rio Supe and the Maya lowlands. [^2]: Technically, &quot;the flatlands north of the Black Sea&quot;. [^3]: The authors do not like the term &quot;mega-sites&quot;, as one point of this chapter is to assign the label of &quot;cities&quot; to places like this. Examples given in the chapter include Yaljanky, Maidenetske, Nevelivka during the early to middle 4th millennium BC (~4000 - 3500 bc) [^4]: Broadly, decisions were made by individuals who shared conceptual frameworks, such as concentric circles (reinforced by the mathematics required), or the shared values and devotions reproduced through everyday actions and festivals. These shared frameworks imparted unity to individual and small group actions. [^5]: Modern archaeology has found the absence of all signs of monarchy (signs of monarchy only become commonplace in the historical record after 2800 bc). These signs include palaces, aristocratic burials, royal inscriptions, defensive walls, and organized militias. This means that, whatever we find out about Sumeria, we can say that it existed before rulers. [^6]: &quot;negatively&quot; meaning: by looking at evidence when we know there <em>weren&#39;t</em> rulers. [^7]: Interestingly, from our contemporary vantage point, this looks like the top-down bureaucratic procedures were &quot;limited&quot; to the &quot;commodity sphere&quot;, while the bottom-up town councils were responsible for public works and &quot;international relations&quot;. This is the opposite of what we expect nowadays, where the city&#39;s bureaucracy is responsible for public works, and &quot;private citizens&quot; engage in commercial activities.
