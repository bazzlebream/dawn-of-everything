term in 30s and 40s, which is a period of time that you see technological powers (modernist, futurist, european declarations, when militarism) -- if you see this, as book undoing Rousseau, someone could take this chapter, and use it, and compare the archaeological evidence, to this early history in the 1930s and 40s of modernism and where this myth is invented, and that would make a nice edition to this genre[^2]</li></ul><p>[[Steve Bachelor]]</p><ul><li>those conceptual constructions of revolution (agricultural, industrial, information), those get preserved and documented because they&#39;re forms of commerce, so what they&#39;re really documenting are the sorts of exploitative transactions that happen among state leaders, or &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; and state authorities</li><li>authors make the point, if one falls into trap of using monuments (?) and agricultural records as proxies for civilization then you&#39;re really just writing a history of the state and commerce, but state-coerced commerce, and that poses a problem for the approach they&#39;re taking <ul><li>because if they are looking at foragers or populations that relied on horticulture, then it&#39;s not going to leave that documentary basis</li><li>so that kind of emphasis on the commercial aspects, wasn&#39;t just a function of the evidence, but also what people though of as legitimate kinds of evidence that i think science can offer tools and technologies to allow for reconstruction of other kinds of evidence</li></ul></li></ul><p>Simona[^3]</p><ul><li>very point of this chapter, and chapter 6, is difference between serious and play agriculture, and the point is that serious agriculture is not a destiny of humanity, it&#39;s not the only possibility at hand, and that there is a bias in our knowledge about the other possibilities</li><li>america before european invasion explored the other possibilities, which is why the focus is so much on indigenous americans, and when they talk about eurasia it&#39;s to confront eurasia solutions against americas solutions</li><li>difference between serious and playful <ul><li>in playful, you have a plurality of solutions to human needs;
