According to Appiah, Kenoyer argues that the ancient site of Mohenjo-daro was \u201Clikely governed as a city-state,\u201D something we dispute in <em>The Dawn of Everything.</em> We are hardly the first to do so. Another expert, Gregory Possehl, argued that the Indus cities were organized on more egalitarian lines, and the most recent scholarship comes down firmly on his side. We don\u2019t cite Kenoyer for his views on political organization, but for his work on urban craft specialization. So what is Appiah\u2019s objection? Is he saying we cannot cite Kenoyer\u2019s insights on any one aspect of Indus archaeology without subscribing to all his other views as well? Does Appiah\u2019s own citation of Alvin Goldman on causal theories of knowledge grant us license to assume he agrees with Goldman on social epistemology?</p></blockquote><ul><li>he says that we cite Kenoyer but that Kenoyer makes the opposite point</li><li>we didn&#39;t cite Kenoyer <em>about what Appiah thinks we&#39;re contradicting in his writing</em>; there is no contradiction with what we present and what Kenoyer says in the part we&#39;re interested in</li><li>we use another expert entirely, Gregory Possehl, to argue the point Appiah thinks we&#39;re confusing with the Kenoyer citation</li></ul>',3),r=[a];function s(h,c,l,p,d,w){return t(),o("div",null,r)}var y=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
