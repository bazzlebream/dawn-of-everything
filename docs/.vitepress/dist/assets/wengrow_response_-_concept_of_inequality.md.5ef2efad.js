In fact, we give a whole series of examples to the contrary. The question we ask is more specific: <strong>How did a consensus form among European intellectuals that human beings\u2014innocent of civilization\u2014lived in \u201Csocieties of equals,\u201D such that it made sense to inquire as to \u201Cthe origins of inequality\u201D</strong>? Appiah\u2019s evocations of Gregory the Great, Thomas M\xFCntzer, Montaigne, and the rest are beside the point, because\u2014while all express powerful sentiments of equality and inequality\u2014<em>none root those ideas in a search for its origins</em>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The notion of a primordial society of equals may have pre-Enlightenment roots in Europe, notably in the constitutional antiquarianism of the seventeenth century (brilliantly discussed by J.G.A. Pocock in <em><a href="./The_Ancient_Constitution_and_the_Feudal_Law.html">The Ancient Constitution and the Feudal Law</a></em>). Jurists appealed to the customary freedoms of a preliterate past as a legal foil to royal absolutism. But Appiah makes no mention of that, or whether he thinks such juridical concepts were already extended beyond specific \u201Cpeoples\u201D and \u201Cnations\u201D to humankind in general. Perhaps because he knows the answer. They were not, or at least, not yet.</p></blockquote><p><strong>&gt; Rousseau\u2019s answer, in 1754, to the novel question \u201CWhat is the origin of inequality?\u201D was, we argue, a synthesis between ideals of human freedom\u2014shaped by Native American critiques of European society\u2014and the concept of history as stages of technological progress, which was then gaining ground through the writings of A.R.J. Turgot.</strong> The just-so story told by Rousseau gave us our modern concept of civilization, whereby each step toward cultural advancement\u2014the invention of agriculture, metallurgy, writing, cities, and the arts, even philosophy itself\u2014came with a loss of freedoms. It\u2019s a familiar and deeply ambivalent story. As we show in <em>The Dawn of Everything</em>, it is also at odds with the facts of modern archaeology and anthropology.&#39;&#39;</p><h2 id="why-myths-endure" tabindex="-1">why myths endure <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-myths-endure" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Appiah finds our reading of Rousseau\u2019s <em>Discourse on Inequality</em> \u201Cperplexing.\u201D How, he asks, could Rousseau promulgate the indigenous critique of European society\u2014with its passionate advocacy of freedom\u2014and smother it at the same time? But surely this is precisely why myths endure. As Claude L\xE9vi-Strauss observed, myths take root in the human imagination by evoking profound oppositions (\u201CMan is born free and everywhere he is in chains\u201D) and then work to mediate those contradictions. \u201CWe will not find our future in our past,\u201D writes Appiah. But myths are not just about our past. They work in the present to circumscribe our understanding of human possibilities. In <em>The Dawn of Everything</em>, we show that conventional tellings of the broad sweep of human history are one such myth, inculcating a profound sense of pessimism about the prospects for change in our societies.</p>',6),i=[s];function r(h,u,c,l,d,p){return o(),t("div",null,i)}var y=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
