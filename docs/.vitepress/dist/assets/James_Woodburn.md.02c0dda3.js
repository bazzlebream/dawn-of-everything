In the post-war decades Woodburn conducted research among the Hadza, a forager society of Tanzania. He also drew parallels between them and the San Bushmen and Mbuti Pygmies, as well as a number of other small-scale nomadic forager societies outside Africa, such as the Pandaram of south India or Batek of Malaysia.8 Such societies are, Woodburn suggests, the only genuinely egalitarian societies we know of, since they are the only ones that extend equality to gender relations and, as much as is practicable, to relations between old and young.\u201D[^1]</p><h2 id="bibliography" tabindex="-1">bibliography <a class="header-anchor" href="#bibliography" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Woodburn, James. 1982.
