Assumes that our strongest social ties are based on close biological kinship</p><p>\u201CSince the problem is typically seen as a result of our evolutionary inheritance, it might be helpful for a moment to return to the source and consider how evolutionary psychologists like Robin Dunbar have typically framed the question. Most begin by observing that the social organization of hunter-gatherers \u2013 both ancient and modern \u2013 operates at different tiers or levels, \u2018nested\u2019 inside one another like Russian dolls. The most basic social unit is the pair-bonded family, with shared investment in offspring. To provide for themselves and dependants, these nuclear units are obliged (or so the argument goes) to cluster together in \u2018bands\u2019 made up of five or six closely related families. On ritual occasions, or when game is particularly abundant, such bands coalesce to form \u2018residential groups\u2019 (or \u2018clans\u2019) of roughly 150 persons, which \u2013 according to Dunbar \u2013 is also around the upper limit of stable, trusting relationships we are cognitively able to keep track of in our heads. And this, he suggests, is no coincidence. Beyond 150 (which has come to be known as \u2018Dunbar\u2019s Number\u2019) larger groups such as \u2018tribes\u2019 may form \u2013 but, Dunbar asserts, these larger groups will inevitably lack the solidarity of smaller, kin-based ones \u201C, and so conflicts will tend to arise within them.\u201D [^1]</p><h2 id="corollary" tabindex="-1">corollary <a class="header-anchor" href="#corollary" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>These nested arrangements shaped human cognition in deep evolutionary time</p><p>[^1]: <a href="./dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.html">The dawn of everything</a> p 279</p>',6),i=[r];function n(l,d,c,h,u,p){return o(),a("div",null,i)}var _=e(s,[["render",n]]);export{m as __pageData,_ as default};
