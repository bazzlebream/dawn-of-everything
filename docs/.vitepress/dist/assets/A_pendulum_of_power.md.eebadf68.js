The only consistent phenomenon is the very fact of alternation, and the consequent awareness of different social possibilities. What all this confirms is that searching for \u2018the origins of social inequality\u2019 really is asking the wrong question. If human beings, through most of our history, have moved back and forth fluidly between different social arrangements, assembling and dismantling hierarchies on a regular basis, maybe the real question should be \u2018how did we get stuck?\u2019 - dawn of everything</p></blockquote><p>CK again?</p><blockquote><p>This final question is a truly profound one. It can only be answered, however, once we have developed some realistic notion of the situation that previously prevailed.
