They concede that extant hunter-gatherers such as the Hadza of Tanzania share their resources, but instead of admiring this, they complain that resistance to accumulation obstructs the emergence of \u2018social complexity\u2019, using this term where others might have spoken of \u2018class\u2019. The authors, it seems, are averse to the concept of social class.</p></blockquote><p>how i understand this (paraphrasing CK unless stated otherwise)</p><ul><li>DoE sets boundary 30kya</li><li>actually there&#39;s evidence for egalitarian lifestyle &quot;three or four times earlier than was previously thought&quot; (which zw gets from previous section about symbolic culture evidence)[^1]</li><li>DoE doesn&#39;t care</li><li>concede that existing societies like the Hadza share resources</li><li>DoE thinks resisting accumulation (surplus) prevents social complexity from emerging</li><li>DoE uses &quot;social complexity&quot; to mean &quot;class&quot;</li><li>to rephrase: DoE thinks resisting surplus prevents classes from emerging, and DoE &quot;complains&quot; about this practice?[^2]</li></ul><h2 id="p2" tabindex="-1">p2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#p2" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><blockquote><p>So, hunter-gatherers obstruct complexity \u2013 i.e., prevent class society from arising \u2013 by resisting the accumulation of wealth. G&amp;W invoke the authority of the hunter-gatherer specialist James Woodburn here. They conclude from his work that \u2018the only way to maintain a truly egalitarian society is to eliminate the possibility of accumulating any sort of surplus at all\u2019 (p. 128). This, they argue, rules out social complexity and \u2013 with it \u2013 the full richness of human cultural and intellectual life.</p></blockquote><ul><li>first sentence checks out</li><li>invoke woodburn</li><li>conclude (quoting CK quoting DoE) \u2018the only way to maintain a truly egalitarian society is to eliminate the possibility of accumulating any sort of surplus at all\u2019</li><li>if you can&#39;t accumulate, you cant get classes / social complexity (they argue) and then you don&#39;t get richness of life</li></ul><p>let&#39;s look at that section in DoE</p><blockquote><p>\u201CIn the nineteenth century, Marx and many of his fellow radicals did imagine that it was possible to administer such a surplus collectively, in an equitable fashion (this is what he envisioned as being the norm under \u2018primitive communism\u2019, and what he thought could once again be possible in the revolutionary future), but contemporary thinkers tend to be more sceptical. In fact, <strong>the dominant view among anthropologists nowadays is that the only way to maintain a truly egalitarian society is to eliminate the possibility of accumulating any sort of surplus at all.</strong>\u201D[^3]</p></blockquote><p><em>they explicitly distance themselves from this conclusion</em>, saying it&#39;s the dominant view -- as we will see, they redefine &quot;egalitarian&quot;</p><h2 id="p3" tabindex="-1">p3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#p3" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Woodburn (1982, 2005) certainly did argue that deliberate resistance to accumulation underpins hunter-gatherer egalitarianism and represents a political choice consciously made. He observed that such egalitarianism was a feature only of non-storage hunter-gatherers, concluding that \u2018immediate return\u2019 was the original type of human economy. But Woodburn did not argue that such egalitarianism was lacking in complexity. In fact, he viewed the binary contrast between \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018complex\u2019 social forms as damaging and misleading. For Woodburn, maintaining egalitarianism was a supremely sophisticated achievement \u2013 demanding far greater levels of political intelligence and complexity than simply allowing inequalities to arise. The Hadza, he explained, have the intelligence to realize how dangerous it would be to let anyone accumulate more wealth than they need.</p></blockquote><p>(correcting DoE on woodburn)</p><ul><li>egalitarianism is feature only of immediate return hunter gatherers, that&#39;s ok</li><li>however, this egalitarianism is complex (and, in fact, there shouldn&#39;t be a contrast between simple and complex, at least in the way it exists)</li><li>maintaining egalitarianism is sophisticated, and requires self-aware political actors and knowledge of the possible alternatives</li></ul><p><em>I still don&#39;t see how this has anything to do with social complexity for DoE</em></p><p>[^1]: i&#39;m not an expert so i dont&#39; know what the previous time was, or what that means about this one [^2]: I don&#39;t know what CK means by &quot;complain&quot; here [^3]: <a href="./dawn_of_everything_graeber_wengrow.html">The dawn of everything</a> p 128</p>',18),s=[n];function r(l,h,c,u,d,p){return a(),t("div",null,s)}var y=e(o,[["render",r]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
