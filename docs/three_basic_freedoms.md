# three basic freedoms to resist hierarchy

We eventually realized that you can reduce resistance to hierarchy to three basic freedoms. Again, we’re not dogmatic. We’re not saying we’ve discovered all of them or anything like that.

The first is something we already talked about today, which is simply the freedom to escape your surroundings and move away, predicated on the expectation that somebody will receive you at your point of destination.

The second freedom is the freedom to disobey arbitrary authority, which is the root of healthy democracy. Not simply disobeying but disobeying with the assurance that you won’t then be ostracized from society. Even the Jesuits, who completely opposed indigenous people’s culture and wanted to convert them, had to concede that they had highly developed cultures of debate.

The reason for that was that while chiefs existed, and they could give orders, nobody had to listen. Nobody had to obey their orders. If you wanted to engage people in a collective project, the only real way to do it was to persuade them. That’s the intellectual tradition that produces Kondiaronk. He emerged from an incredibly rich culture of debate, persuasion, and oratory.

The third freedom, which is really built on the first two, is simply the freedom to imagine a new society. In other words, the freedom to tear a little hole in the fabric of your society, reconfigure it in another form, and then actually make that happen. That seems to be what our ancestors were doing for most of history.

But it also seems to be what we’ve forgotten how to do. We haven’t lost equality. Rather, we’ve lost the freedom to imagine and reinvent the ways we live together and take part in that collectively.
