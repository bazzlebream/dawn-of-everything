# Rousseau's theory of the origin of the state

(Well, G&W's paraphrase of Rousseau's theory)
## 1. outline
- material surplus =>
- full-time specialists who claim it =>
- full-time specialists get it and live off it =>
- others do the same =>
- these band together as elites =>
- (private property?) =>
- the state

> Conventional wisdom also tells us that the moment a material surplus does become possible, there will also be full-time craft specialists, warriors and priests laying claim to it, and living off some portions of that surplus (or, in the case of warriors, spending the bulk of their time trying to figure out new ways to steal it from each other); and before long, merchants, lawyers and politicians will inevitably follow. These new elites will, as Rousseau emphasized, band together to protect their assets, so the advent of private property will be followed, inexorably, by the rise of ‘the state’.[^1]
