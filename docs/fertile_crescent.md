# Fertile Crescent

## 1. the term

### 1.1. geopolitical

- term "Fertile Crescent" invented in 19th century (when European imperial powers partitioning it according to their strategic interests)
- widely adopted among researchers to mean:
	- area from eastern shores of Mediterranean to the foothills of the [[Zagros Mountains]], crossing parts of Syria, Turkey, and Iraq
- only prehistorians use it now, to indicate the region where farming began

### 1.2. ecological

- really multiple crescents
- around 10,000 bc (end of last glacial period) area went in two distinct directions, an upland and a lowland crescent

#### 1.2.1. upland crescent

> follows the foothills of the Taurus and Zagros Mountains, running north of the modern border between Syria and Turkey. For foragers at the end of the last Ice Age, it would have been something of an open frontier; an expanding belt of oak-pistachio forest and game-rich prairie intersected by river valleys.

#### 1.2.2. lowland crescent

> characterized by *Pistacia* woodlands, as well as tracts of fertile terrain bound tightly to river systems or to the shores of lakes and artesian springs, beyond which lay deserts and barren plateaus.[^1]
