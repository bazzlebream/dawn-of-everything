# Eros and Magic in the Renaissance (notes)

## 1. introduction
- Contemporary psychological and social sciences are indirectly derived from Renaissance magic[^2]
	- psychoanalysis, applied psychosociology, mass psychology
	- "magic and science [...] represent needs of the imagination"
	- "the transition from a society dominated by magic to a predominantly scientific society is explicable primarily by a change in the imaginary."
- **magic**
	- key terms:
		- phantasy
			- "manipulation of phantasms"; aspects:
				- eroticism
				- mnemonics (Art of Memory)
		- eroticism
			- "magic is merely eroticism applied, directed, and aroused by its performer"
	- a science of the imaginary[^1]
		- "magic is primary directed at the human imagination, in which it attempts to create lasting impressions"
- a Renaissance magician was a kind of proto-politics/pr person

- intended subject matter:
	- "human imagination as revealed in documents relating to eroticism and magic in the Renaissance"
- the issue of "pretense"[^3]
- methodology?
	- "examines changes at the level of the imaginary rather than at the level of scientific discoveries"[^4]
