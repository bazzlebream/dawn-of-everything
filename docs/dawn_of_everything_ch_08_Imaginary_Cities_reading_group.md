Steve Bachelor:
- they are trying to debunk one of the biggest teleologies in the social sciences, which is "the question of scale'"
- conventional wisdom is that, hierarchy is a necessary part of that process
- G&W show that hasn't always been the case
	- so any theory that says it's natural to the human condition, then why are there cities that consciously organized themselves in egalitarian ways
- they use Mesopotamia (where conventional wisdom applied when it took root) but also other sites
- Ukranian megasites
- Indus / [Harappa](Harappa.md) civilization
	- "nameless" civ because there are not personal identifiers on objects
- the teleology is:
	- the idea that as population density increases, so does hierarchy
	- G&W show: this isn't fact of human nature
		- places 30k or more people that show forms of egalitarianism
- examples of cities where egalitarian existed
- conclude chapter with "anecdote" from Taosi China in northern frontier with Mongolia
	- 2000 bce, city wall razed, and original functional divisions destroyed
	- commoners cover almost entire site
	- entire former palace area becomes poor-quality rammed earth formation of 2000 sq meters, surrounded by low-status trash pits
	- mass burials with signs of torture and violence
		- "grotesque acts of political retribution" (the source G&W cite?)
- shows that cities were conscious political constructions, and people even in neolithic past could alter social arrangements to promote egalitarianism
	- and as they did so, city expands in population and surface area
- talk about possibilities that DG said are always in us
	- passage is wonderful reminder of directions human potential can go
	- or what they suggest was actually an economic flowering of the region: these possibilities are always in us
- couldn't help but be misguided by own thinking about what social revolution looks like
	-
