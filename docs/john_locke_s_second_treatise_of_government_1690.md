# John Locke's Second Treatise of Government (1690)

- property rights are necessarily derived from labor
- when you work the land, you "mix" your labor with the land
- the land becomes an extension of the persion (in a sense)
- (the notion of the "improving landlord") (ie a lord over the land? who improves the land by working it)
