# Wealth inequalities not OK

## p1

> According to G&W, however, wealth inequalities are unproblematic. In support of their position, they invoke Kandiaronk, the seventeenth century First American critic of European ‘civilization’ to whom they devote an inspiring chapter. Somewhat unconvincingly, they assure us that Kandiaronk and his First American co-thinkers ‘had trouble even imagining that differences of wealth could be translated into systematic inequalities of power’ (p. 130).[^1]

- DoE think wealth inequalities are unproblematic
- they argue this (unconvincingly) by saying that Kandiaronk, of all people, couldn't imagine translating wealth into inequalities[^2]

ZW:
- They aren't saying that wealth inequalities are unproblematic, they are saying that, for Kandiaronk, who considered himself to live in an egalitarian society (at least compared to Europeans), it wasn't the existence or lack of wealth disparities that made him think his society was egalitarian, but rather the existence or lack of substantive freedoms (autonomy, mutual aid and obligation, protecting liberties)
- They say this because they are trying to get to a better definition of "egalitarianism", which they come to associate with these substantive freedoms, mutual aid, etc, rather than a wealth-oriented definition

- i don't know if CK really thinks that DoE thinks that wealth inequalities are unproblematic; if he does, it's certainly understandable that he gets so upset

## p2-3

> G&W accept that immediate-return hunter-gatherers refuse to allow wealth inequalities to develop. But surprisingly, they regard this whole situation as disappointing:

> This might sound like the basis of something hopeful or optimistic. Actually, it’s anything but. What it suggests is, again, that any equality worth the name is essentially impossible for all but the very simplest foragers. What kind of future might we then have in store? (p. 129)

ZW
- DoE are arguing that, if we use a wealth-based definition of egalitarianism, rather than an autonomy-based one, the only logical conclusion is that the only egalitarian society would be, if we take Woodburn at his description, that of immediate return hunter gatherers

## p4
> What kind of future? They answer this by suggesting that activists who take inspiration from African hunter-gatherers are inviting modern city-dwellers to become ‘stuck,’ like the unfortunate Hadza, in the repetitive simplicity of life in tiny nomadic bands.

Quoting from DoE, this is not what they mean by 'stuck" here:

> “Far from rushing blindly for their chains like Rousseau’s savages, Woodburn’s ‘immediate return hunter-gatherers’ understand precisely where the chains of captivity loom, and organize much of their lives to keep away from them. This might sound like the basis of something hopeful or optimistic. Actually, it’s anything but. What it suggests is, again, that any equality worth the name is essentially impossible for all but the very simplest foragers. What kind of future might we then have in store? At best, we could perhaps imagine (with the invention of Star Trek replicators or other immediate-gratification devices) that it might be possible, at some point in the distant future, to create something like a society of equals once more. But in the meantime, we are definitively stuck. ”[^3]

This makes it clear that "stuck" means: stuck in *our current situation of hierarchy*, since until we have replicators, it's impossible to have the lives we have now without stores of food and other things like clothing or building materials for houses. It seems like CK is upset that they are criticizing Hadza life; if this were so, it would certainly be, among other things, unkind, but I don't think they are; and they certainly don't say anything like "repetitive simplicity of life".

## p5

> To be clear, I am no primitivist. I am in favor of technological, social and political development. The Hadza illustrate that it is fulfilling and enjoyable to share wealth on demand, to laugh and sing, to ‘waste time’ in play, to resist letting anyone dominate us – and to prioritize caring for each other’s children over all other concerns. When it comes to development, these politically sophisticated bow-and-arrow hunters can teach us a lot.

This paragraph reaffirms my thought that CK is worried DoE think that the lives of people who identify as Hadza are not fulfilling and not enjoyable. I'm not sure why.
