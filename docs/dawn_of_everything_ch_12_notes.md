# Dawn of Everything: Chapter 12 "Conclusion" - notes

## ??

- asking about origin of inequality is wrong question
	- so, Roussea and Hobbes ideas (only rousseau does the question even come up)

- problem with Hobbes ?? narrative: (if it's so great compared to the alternative) why didn't this civilization spread without colonialism or imperialism? and why did people defect from it when given the choice
- no one at the time was talking about this, because they were aware if it ?
- dominant narrative:
	- obsession with dangers of decadence and disintegration
		- racists: "most humans not capable of progress, let's exterminate them"
		- others ("reactionary thinkers"): "Enlightenment improvement schemes too naive"
			- this is primarily where modern [[social theory]] emerges
			- retrospecting chaotic aftermath of French Revolution, concerned more with misery and unrest at home, not disasters on foreigners away
			- [[social sciences]] conceived around two questions
				- what went wrong with Enlightenment project, unity of scientific and moral progress, schemes for improvement of society?
				- why do well-meaning attempts to fix problems so often make things worse?

- those concerned with 1st q saw Rousseau asking it well
- those concerned with 2nd q represented him as clueless villain, simple-minded revolutionary who though established order could be brushed aside
	- held him personally responsible for guillotine

[[19th century "traditionalists"]] (which ones are these?)
- responsible for modern social theory (NOT the Enlightenment philosophes)
	> almost all the great issues of modern social science – tradition, solidarity, authority, status, alienation, the sacred – were first raised in the works of men like the theocratic [[vicomte de bonald]], the monarchist [[comte de maistre]], or the whig politician and philosopher [[edmund burke]] as examples of the kind of stubborn social realities which they felt that enlightenment thinkers, and rousseau in particular, had refused to take seriously, with (they insisted) disastrous results. [^1]

- debates between radicals and reactionaries didn't end, just pop up in different forms
	- today: right = Enlightenment; left = critics of En
- but everyone agrees:
	- there was "The Enlightenment"
	- marked a break in human history
	- American and French revolutions were, in part, result of this rupture (break)
	- introducing possibility of self-conscious projects for reshaping society (aka genuinely revolutionary politics)
		- dismissed the insurrections and visionary movements before 1700 as people insisting on return to "ancient ways" or acting on vision from God

### the argument that pre-Enlightenment societies were not self-conscious political actors who could intervene on themselves

[longer quote](the_pre_enlightenment_societies_were_not_self_conscious_argument.md)

#### anthropologists (who change) study societies (that don't change)
- manifestations in Anthropology
	- uses "eternal present" / ahistorical terms / implied timeless and unchanging
	- historical events unpredictable
	- more scientific to study predictable things
		- daily round, seasonal cycles, rites of passage, patterns of dynamic succession, growing and splitting of villages (emphasis on same structure enduring)
		- "anthropologists wrote this way because they considered themselves scientists (‘structural-functionalists’, in the jargon of the day)."; makes the subjects of study seem opposite: like not-scientists where nothing happened

## Eliade on cyclical time:

- **traditional** societies live in **cyclical** time
	- everything important already happened
	- any true historical (unpredictable) event eventually attributed to first god action (aka archetype)
- **linear**/ **historical** time is opposite, notion that history is going somewhere (historical events significant in relation to future also, in addition to past)
	- to Eliade, this was recent innovation in human thought
	- leads to anxiety and nihilism = "the terror of history"
		- he was a fascist
		- said introduced by Judaism and Old Testament
- [ • • • two obviously absurd positions this leads to]

## why is it hard to imagine people from the past making their own history

answer: how we define science and social science

- social science about how human beings not free; determined by forces outside control
	- an account showing humans shaping own structures, written off as awaiting "real" scientific explanation
	- it's why big histories place explanation outside humans, as in on primary materials (Bronze Age), or revolutionary breakthroughs (Agricultural Revolution)

### Zone of ritual play

- in fact, agriculture wasn't like invention of the steam engine
	- it and other innovations based on collective body of knowledge accumulated over centuries, by women, humble and significant discoveries
	- i don't remember where this was said earlier:
		- the results of such experiments were often preserved and transmitted through ritual, games and forms of play (or even more, perhaps, at the point where ritual, games and play shade into each other). [^2]

[Zone of ritual play](zone_of_ritual_play.md)
(remember the "ritual" part here too)
- scientific lab and repertory of knowledge and techniques which might be applied to pragmatic problems
- also, importantly, social experimentation
- zone is library of social possibilities

#### A M Hocart said it first? :

[principle of zone of ritual play as compendium of possibilities](principle_of_zone_of_ritual_play_as_compendium_of_possibilities.md)
[A M Hocart](a_m_hocart.md)
- monarchy and government institutions derived from rituals channeling powers of life from cosmos into human society
- [ • • • woh i would not have gotten there from here the way they were describing it]
- "first kings must have been dead kings"
- individuals so treated only became sacred rulers at funerals
- [ • • • i don't understand how this is completely connected]: to the astonishment of many, but much as [Hocart](a_m_hocart.md) predicted, the (book says "upper paleolithic" - not sure if the link is right though, to European)  [upper paleolithic](european_upper_paleolithic.md) really has produced evidence of grand burials, carefully staged for individuals who indeed seem to have attracted spectacular riches and honours, largely in death.

[principle](principle_of_zone_of_ritual_play_as_compendium_of_possibilities.md) applies to all sorts of institutions
- monarchy
- aristocracy
- private property
- police functions
- powers of command
- formal democratic procedures (election, sortition) - deployed to limit said powers

evidence doesn't just show this ritual year as compendium, but people actually lived (in) these possibilities for parts of the year

## getting stuck

[[theory that the thing that went wrong was when people started losing freedom to imagine and enact other forms of social existence]]
- even anthropologists like [Pierre Clastres](pierre_clastres.md),  [Christopher Boehm](boehm_christopher.md) who say humans always able to imagine other possibilities, still say / imply that for 95% of history, they only wanted small-scale society of equals

**see: Roman confusion between care and domination (below) for finalish answer**

### framing the problem as: refusing Cahokia was possible and worked, but refusing France and it all fucked up (ie they did try)

better way to frame problem:

- why (how?) possible for [[eastern_woodlands_of_north_america]] ancestors to refute Cahokia and reorganize into free republics, but when the French tried to do it, the result was disastrous

#### why did revolution-ish work for native americans but not french?

- the difference is thinking of freedom as practical vs abstract ideal or formal principle
- basic forms of social liberty:
	- move away
	- disobey
	- shape new social realities
- the first two are "scaffolding" for the third aka "propping up" the third freedom

#### how "propping up the third freedom" works

- as long as first two freedoms taken for granted, as in North America,
	- kings could only ever be play kings (same for any other hierarchy or system of authority)
	- seasonal police that rotated annually was (in a sense) a play police force
- nowadays, we don't even really have first or second either

- how did it happen
- how did we get stuck
- how stuck are we

#### culture areas: epochal development

- gradual division of human societies into culture areas
	- neighbors define selves against each other, exaggerating differences
	- ie cultural schismogenesis
	- can be self-conscious (Northwest Coast, refusing slavery)
	- end of last Ice Age onwards too (archaeological evidence)
		- but why or what constitutes boundary?

##### mesolithic:

- post-Ice Age (Mesolithic) hunter-gatherers in Golden Age
	- local experiments
	- opulent burials
	- monumental architecture
	- multiplication of distinct culture areas
	- **first clear indication of permanent rank divisions + violence**
	- hierarchy and stratification, in some cases, fixed in place

##### violence permanentizes play: origins of warfare

- "play kings cease to be play kings precisely when they start killing people"
	- see: excess of ritual violence during transitions
	- same (?) is true of war (that being, if you're killed, you're dead)
		**- but no reason to assume "war" has always existed**		
	- - war isn't just "organized violence": [[Raymond Kelly]]'s [principle of social substitutability](social_substitutability.md)
		- murder of whole populations only one step further (logically)
		- this arrangement - no reason to assume human hardwired
			- on the contrary, usually have to use a bit of techniques to do it (systematic yet indiscriminate killing)

- little evidence of warfare during Paleolithic
- also, manifests as theatrical sometimes
- "play war"
	- even Homeric-style warfare

- but, **evidence for massacres at end of last Ice Age in neolithic village dwellers in central Europe**
	- evidence is uneven (violence alternate with peace , hundreds of years peace)
	- long periods of time AFTER agriculture adopted, that war successfully abolished (apparently)
	- evidence that war and agriculture could be abolished

##### new question: relationship between external warfare and internal loss of freedoms (looking towards Roman POWs), made possible systems of rankings, which made possible large-scale systems of domination

- if a relationship, how direct (correlation)
- WARNING: don't assume these ancient polities were just old versions of modern system

again:

state made of combo of elements

- elements have different origins
- nothing determined about combination now
- elements map directly to forms of social power
- those forms can operate at any scale of human interaction
	- (family to Empire or super-kingdom)

[ • • •] some recap

first-order regimes

second-order regimes

(aka, again refuting that these "early states" are better seen as combos of 2 of 3 elements)

###### close connection between patriarchal household and military might (aka violence)

again: question of warfare (outside the society) and loss of freedoms within society

- spectacular violence
- modeled center of power on organization of patriarchal households (i think i missed evidence of this)
- coincidence?

**why** this "close connection between patriarchal household and military might (aka violence)"

we've had to use imperial language to try to answer this, which already implied explanation and justification

- the imperial language derives from Roman Law
- our language is more scientific / neutral

### our social structure comes from Roman law that "freedom" is the authority a slave-owner has over a POW-slave, combined with the fact that the slave does the care and nurturing of that slave-owner

#### (and also keep in mind that, ahead, the Wendat households were defined in exactly opposite terms)

[Roman Law conception of natural freedom](roman_law_conception_of_natural_freedom.md)
- based on power of male head of household to dispose of property (abusus)
- "rights" are different - they are negotiated with others and involve mutual obligations
- so natural freedom is power
	- implies freedom is primordial exception to the legal order
	- implies property not understandings between people, but relationship between person and object, characterized by absolute power
- "What does it mean to say one has the natural right to do anything one wants with a hand grenade, say, except those things one isn’t allowed to do? Who would come up with such an odd formulation?"

[[theory of Roman Law property and freedom tracing back to slave law]]
- [Orlando Patterson](orlando_patterson.md)
	- trace back to slave law
	- can imagine property as domination between person and thing because in Roman Law, power of master rendered slave a "thing" (res), not a person with rights
	- property law mostly about situations coming about because of that formulation
- remember, the jurists who laid this all out were patriarchs with total authority over household, and had dozens or hundreds of slaves

### now i'm guessing we get into the violence / nurture thing  • • • (509)

- for Romans
	- in terms of legal theory these slaves were classified as captive foreigners (Prisoners of War) who, conquered in battle, had forfeited rights of any kind.
	- freedom and liberty (not rights) were private affairs
		- (you could do anything to the slaves that nurtured you)
	- private life characterized by absolute power of patriarch over conquered people (property)
		- (you could do anything to the slaves that nurtured you)
- slave legal status defined in those terms (prisoners of war)
	- most roman slaves not prisoners of war, but didn't matter, since the law defined them that way

ok, here we go

- remember the [principle of social substitutability](social_substitutability.md) ?
	- ie enemies interchangeable
	- don't think this is the substitutability bit:
		- if enemies surrendered, could be killed, or rendered socially dead, sold as things, commodities
- soooo … potential for arbitrary violence (against this POW-thing) inserted into most intimate sphere of social relations (household?) including "relations of care that made domestic life possible" (since slaves took care of them)

in Rome, we see extreme of this:  particular nexus of violence and care

- and that's where we get our concepts of social structure from

family < familia (everyone under domestic authority of single paterfamilias) < Latin famulus (house slave)

domestic, domesticated, dominium (emperor's sovereignty and citizen's power over private property) < Latin domus (household)

following "line of thought"

### historically: what happened to POWs

- direct evidence of warfare, massacres, POW detected long before kingdoms/empires
	- hard to tell what happened to POWs
	- things not clear-cut; multiple possibilities

#### Wendat mourning wars, POWs

- Kandiaronk times
- very warlike
- Jesuits appalled
- reasons for war different from Europeans, tho
- all were "mourning wars" - assuage grief of close relatives of someone killed
	- typically: attack "traditional" enemies, kill some and bring some prisoners back
		- captive women and children were adopted
		- men's fate up to mourners
			- one: given name, even original killed's name, become that other person, in a few years treated as full member of society
			- two: excruciating death by torture
				- "slow, public, highly theatrical use of violence"
				- everyone took part, even women and children
				- went on for days, a communal affair
			- this is the same Wendat who didn't spank children, "directly" punish thieves or murderers, or artibrary authority
			- no in-between
			- can't just say it's venting the flipside of non-violent community, since, in [[Middle Woodland]] phase (100 bc - 500 ad), relative peace
				- so … at some point, found way to ensure vendettas didn't become warfare
				- other times, that broke down, torture returned

meaning of it all?

comparing with Europe:

- Wendat who saw French doing same thing appalled that French did it to "men from among themselves" rather than external enemies

comparison

- Wendat actions against POWS (the ones not adopted)
	- community becomes single body (solidarity of group)
		- united by capacity for violence
	- violence excluded from realm of family and household
	- in nurturing some, proclaime internal sanctity of family, and domestic realm as "spaces of female governance where violence, politics, and rule by command did not belong"
		- aka defined exactly opposite to Roman familia
	- EITHER
		- loving care
		- worst treatment imaginable
		- no middle ground
- France
	- "the people" were all potential victims of king's violence
	- could enact violence against (metaphorical) family and household
		- anyone could be a public victim, whether guilty or innocent
	- looks like ancient Rome when compared with Wendat
		- model of subordination similar for house and kingdom
			- both models for each other (patriarch, king)
			- superior party "exercise violence with impunity"
			- assumed to be "bound up with love and affection" (well, at least going from the subordinated to the higher-up ?)
	- aka domination + care
	- idea that this was all a form of love (from top-down); taking care of subjects/ children

Europe: top-down violence within household (or bigger) is form of love

- unite violence and care

Wendat: no physical violence should ever take place in household (or bigger)

- completely separate violence and care

It seems to us that this connection – or better perhaps, confusion – between care and domination is utterly critical to the larger question of how we lost the ability freely to recreate ourselves by recreating our relations with one another.

- critical to understanding how we got stuck

## they go over misconceptions?

some form of:

doing x implies permanently giving up freedom y

### scale (freedom 2)

- anti: structures of domination assured result of populations scaling up
	- (that is, correspondence between social and spacial hierarchies)
	- then, complexity used as synonym for hierarchy
	- then, hierarchy used to mean "chains of command"
	- (which means: as soon as you live with a bunch of people, you abandon 2nd freedom (refuse orders) and replace it with "legal mechanisms for beating up those who don't do as they're told")
- pro: none of these are theoretically essential
	- [[Carole Crumley]] been saying this for years
		- complex systems, in both natural and social world, don't have to be top-down organized
			- (zw: we already assume this in natural world?)

#### living in cities (specific example )

- submit to rule of admins, priests, kings, warrior-politicians to "avert chaos or cognitive overload"
- (this sees "violence of modern society emerging naturally from structures of rational management and paternalistic care" (care-domination))
- ignores archaeological evidence
	- cities started as huge experiments lacking admin hierarchy and authoritarian rule
	- there's no good terminology yet for these
		**- "egalitarian" means too many things
			- urban parliament
			- coordinated projects of social housing
			- self-organizing autonomous households into neighborhoods
			- explicit notion of equality based on uniformity and sameness**[^3]

##### not surprising, given what preceded cities

- not rudimentary, isolated groups
- far-flung networks of societies, diverse ecologies,
- stuff moving between (people, plants, animals, drugs, value objects, songs, ideas)
- individual units may have been small, but usually coalitions or confederacies larger
	- aka [[Hospitality Zones]]
	- logical outcome of freedom 1, with "received, cared for, and values in distant place"
	- at most, [[amphictyony]]
	- [Marcel Mauss](Marcel_Mauss.md): we should use "civilization" only for these [Hospitality Zones](Hospitality_Zones.md)
		- Wengrow makes similar point in Civilizations
- classic #graeber-inversion :
	- not civilization emerging in cities,
	- but hospitality zones (confederacy, regional coalition) compressed, is a city

### actual origin of structures of domination

(again, NOT "mere existence of large human settlements" - didn't cause, and didn't make inevitable)

#### hereditary aristocracies

- just as likely in small or "modest-sized" groups
	- [heroic societies](theory_of_heroic_societies.md) of Anatolian highlands
		- (schismogenesis? with Mesopotamian cities)
		- evidence for "monarchy as a permanant institution" seems to be there
- as an example that cities don't automatically lead to monarchy, there's [Teotihuacan](Teotihuacan.md), where population reversed course on the [Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon](pyramids_of_the_sun_and_the_moon.md) and then did social housing

?? "opposite trajectory"
- cities start with neighborhood councils, popular assemblies
- end up rules by warlike dynasts
- dynasts have to coexist with those older urban government institutions
	- [theory of convergence between systems of violence and systems of care](theory_of_convergence_between_systems_of_violence_and_systems_of_care.md)

##### Sumerian temples: those bereft of social ties (needy, slaves and POWs, kings)

[Temple of Inanna](temple_of_inanna.md)
[ • • • and skips around]

wtf are we talking about here:

[ • • • kings taking over the spaces]
	(the **external violence** part?)

- Sumerian temples organized economically around providing for gods (nurture/care)
	- cult statues
	- industry and bureaucracy of welfare
	- charitable institutions
		- regular rations
		- pub to work on land and in workshops
		- **first factories were charitable institutions like this**
	- (long before kings)
	- women "must have" had certain dignity, as dedicated to gods
- but by time of written documents, situation more complicated
- goes from just the needy, to also war captives and slaves
	- (all bereft of family support)
	- status of widows and orphans downgraded, so more like a poorhouse
		- **how affect status of women more generally**
			- fleeing domestic abuse was even scarier
				- aka loss of first freedom, which meant increasingly loss of 2nd, and "Effacement" of third freedom
				- women going for #3 (new cult, temple, vision of social relations) would be marked as subversive, revolutionary, maybe confronted by military

##### kings and slaves are structurally the same, but on opposite ends of power spectrum

- no relatives / no kin
	- kings: shouldnt', at least: rulesr of all subjects equally
	- slaves: by definition, severing of relationships and possibility thereof too
- so, only recognized social relationships "based on power and domination"

### return to the question (not sure what we've gained in the meantime): how stuck in one form of social, and how relations based on violence and domination normalized within that form? [^4]

#### pre-servile institutions (Franz Steiner) and how loss of first freedom "paves way" for loss of second

- [Franz Steiner](franz_steiner.md) and the missing doctoral work on slavery
- [[pre-servile institutions]]
	- what happens in different cultural and historical situations to people who become unmoored
		- expelled from clans for debt or fault
		- castaways
		- criminals
		- runaways
	- one interpretation: how refugees were welcomed, almost as sacred, then degraded and exploited
		- see: women in Sumerian temples above
		- aka, an erosion of "the expectations that make freedom of movement possible" (1st freedom)
			- expectations: norms of hospitality, asylum, civility, shelter
			- why is this "catalyst for situations where some can exert arbitrary power over others"

answer to clastres and lowie question:

- if stateless societies organize so chiefs have no coercive power, how did top-down forms of organization (admin?) come into world at all?
	- clastres and lowie said: product of religious revelation
	- Steiner: charity

#zw ok so if this requires POWs, and war requires … this ,maybe? is it circular?

##### the charity => top-down theory

- all these types of people (orphans, widows, mad, disabled, deformed, war captives, esp children, runaways, debtors, criminals) become "members of the chief's retinue"
	- younger males become police-like enforcers
	- actual amount of power chief had over retainers varied (basically on existence of freedom 1 to wards, or maintaining ties with those who would defend them)
	- what matters is the sheer potential (Even if henchmen's reliability varied)
- process of "giving refuge" itself led to transformation of domestic arrangements
	- incorporating captured women (reinforcing *[[potestas]]*)
- can see this logic in almost all royal courts documented
	- attracted the "freakish" or "detached"; but rulers also claimed to protect widows and orphans
		- (i remember, one of the boasts of the heroic-warrior types)
- projecting back:
	- quite possible this was happening in early hunter-gatherer communities
		- re: "physically anomalous individuals with lavish burials in last Ice Age": probably focus of a lot of care while alive
		- "no doubt" there are "sequences of developments" linking that practice to later royal courts
			- a glimpse in [[Predynastic Egypt]] ??
			- but can't reconstruct links

origins of patriarchy

connection between external (largely male) violence (aka POWs, war captives) and transformation of women's status in home ?

## reflections on research

- has been case of lumping together all "non-egalitarian" cities or societies (which is all of them, since you have to prove complete lack of structural inequality all over, according to peeps), which means grouping things that are very different
