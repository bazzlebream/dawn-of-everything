- About the only dependable way anyone has ever discovered to determine whether one way of living is really more satisfying, fulfilling, happy or otherwise preferable to any other is to allow people to fully experience both, give them a choice, then watch what they actually do.

	- [Helena Valero](helena_valero.md): A woman of Spanish descent who chooses to live with the Yanomani after experience with "both" worlds

	- [letter from Benjamin Franklin to a friend](letter_from_benjamin_franklin_to_a_friend.md): Native Americans always return to their families, and White people also return to Native American families
