# Letters from a Peruvian Woman

[Madame Graffigny](Madame_Graffigny.md)

First edition: 1747:[^2]

- Viewed French society through eyes of imaginary kidnapped Inca princess [[Zilia]]
	- critical of "vanities and absurdities" of Europe, as well as of patriarchy
- Considered feminist landmark
	- (European novel about woman and she doesn't die or marry at the end)
- Introduced notion of state socialism

Second edition: 1751
- [Graffigny](Madame_Graffigny.md) sends letters to friends asking for changes
- [Turgot](Turgot.md) responds, highly critical
	- the point where he began to turn his most lasting contribution to human thought – the idea of material economic progress – into a general theory of history.[^3]

> Turgot tried to get Graffigny to change the ending of the book so that Princess Zilia sees the error of her ways and realizes that, to live in a technologically sophisticated society, you need division of labor and money — both of which imply class differences. Graffigny said no, published her book as intended, and Turgot spent the next few years getting his intellectual revenge.[^1]
