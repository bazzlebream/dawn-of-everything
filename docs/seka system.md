# seka system
on Bali

	- Bali ranking (not the seka system) extends to every individual, not just caste
		- seka system is: everyone expected to "participate on equal terms and come to deicsions by consensus"

“whose population adopted Hinduism in the Middle Ages. Balinese are not only divided by caste: their society is conceived as a total hierarchy in which not just every group but every individual knows (or at least, should know) their exact position in relation to everyone else. In principle, then, there are no equals, and most Balinese would argue that in the greater cosmic scheme of things, this must always be so.”
