# The original affluent society

- author [[marshall_sahlins]]
- "last great example of" [[speculative prehistory]]

## 1. argument

- Victorian narrative of "continual improvement" is backwards regarding working hours
- Historical trend has been for people to work more over time
- For much of early history, human lives were materially abundant

- "abundance" is not an absolute measure; (it's relative to the society? or the person?)
	- "a situation where one has easy access to everything one feels one needs to live a happy and comfortable life"
	- if your needs are easy to satisfy, for example, then you can live in abundance with little "work"

## 2. criticisms

### 2.1. Dawn of Everything

- this broad picture appears to be correct, with certain caveats[^1]
- however, his chosen ethnographic examples convey an incorrect picture of the prehistoric lives he was speculating about
	- this is because of the examples he chose (which were ethnographic rather than archaeological) of African foragers:
		- [San](san_bushmen.md)
		- [Mbuti](mbuti_pygmies.md)
		- [Hadza](east_african_hadza.md)

- (See [Dawn of Everything: Ch 3: Unfreezing the Ice Age (notes)](dawn_of_everything_ch_3_unfreezing_the_ice_age.md)) for why these particular societies were used as examples in the 1960s.)[^2]

- 1960s time-allocation studies by anthropologists
	- because of related fossil discoveries, it seemed like living populations could tell us something about the "original state" of human society
	- results were surprising
		- everyone at the time believed the [[struggle_for_existence]] line they were being fed
		- so, results that showed that, even in relatively undesirable locations, you could still feed everyone and have over half your time for doing pleasurable activities[^3]

#theme(s)
- foragers knew about all there was to know about plants already, including how they might go about play-farming (or at least planting and harvesting)
- self-conscious social decisions have once again been cast as ignorance
	- the decision not to farm because of all the nuts, etc
	- keep your leisure

- Sahlins' larger conclusions:
	- reject [Rousseau’s version of the Fall](rousseaus_version_of_the_fall.md)
	- instead:
		- the leisure ethos collapsed when people settled and chose onerous agriculture[^4]
		- if farming was a conscious choice (as the ethnographies indicate through interviews)
		- then so is embracing it
		- ie. we "chose to eat the fruit of knowledge" (knowing what would happen), and we were consequently punished[^5]
		- and furthermore, this same decision (and consequence) is consciously made over and over again with each new technological advance

#### 2.1.1. the one obvious flaw

The specific ethnographic examples which Sahlins chose (marginal hunters / African foragers) made it seem like their way of life was the "original human society". However, Sahlins himself recognized that prehistoric humans likely lived in many different kinds of "affluent societies", including ones resembling other ethnographic examples, such as the [foragers in northwestern California](foragers_in_northwestern_california.md), or [fisher-foragers of the Canadian Northwest Coast](fisher_foragers_of_the_canadian_northwest_coast.md). Before agriculture, humans had tens of thousands of years to experiment with all sorts of modes of societal organizations, including wildly different "affluent" kinds: at least as diverse as those represented in the ethnological sources.

#stuck

Therefore, there is no truly original state of affairs (unless it be this experimental freedom). What needs to be explained is how that flexibility was lost and we became fixed in "permanent relations of dominance and subordination".[^6]

> Probably the most influential anthropological essay ever written, it turned that old Victorian wisdom – still prevalent in the 1960s – on its head, creating instant discussion and debate, inspiring everyone from socialists to hippies. Whole schools of thought (Primitivism, Degrowth) would likely have never come about without it. But Sahlins was also writing at a time when archaeologists still knew relatively little about pre-agricultural peoples, at least compared to what we know now. It might be best, then, first to take a look at his argument before turning to the evidence we have today and seeing how the piece measures up against it.[^7]

[^2]: > As we pointed out above, the average oppressed medieval serf still worked less than a modern nine-to-five office or factory worker, and the hazelnut gatherers and cattle herders who dragged great slabs to build Stonehenge almost certainly worked, on average, less than that. It’s only very recently that even the richest countries have begun to turn such things around (obviously, most of us are not working as many hours as Victorian stevedores, though the overall decline in working hours is probably not as dramatic as we think). And for much of the world’s population, things are still getting worse instead of better. p 136
[^3]: But from this current chapter:
	> In the last chapter, we suggested a number of reasons why !Kung San (Bushmen) on the margins of the Kalahari and Hadza of the Serengeti Plateau became so popular in the 1960s as exemplars of what early human society might have been like (despite being quite unusual, as foragers go). One reason was simply the availability of data: by the 1960s, they were among the only foraging populations left who still maintained something like their traditional mode of life. p 136
[^4]: assuming, of course, that you hadn't set up your food-getting to be pleasurable in the first place, which, given the amount of free time they had, seems unlikely (unlikely that they hadn't, that is)
[^5]: uh and [St. Augustin's theory of infinite desires](st_augustin_s_theory_of_infinite_desires.md) ??
[^6]: > The ancient forager ethos of leisure (the ‘Zen road to affluence’) only broke down, or so Sahlins surmised, when people finally – for whatever reasons – began to settle in one place and accept the toils of agriculture. They did so at a terrible cost. It wasn’t just ever-increasing hours of toil that followed but, for most, poverty, disease, war and slavery – all fuelled by endless competition and the mindless pursuit of new pleasures, new powers and new forms of wealth.
